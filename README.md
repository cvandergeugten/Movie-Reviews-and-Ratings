# Movie-Reviews-and-Ratings
Simple NLP analysis on text reviews

The goal of this project was to obtain real-world text data from a website and then analyze the text data to make predictions about a particular variable in the dataset. In this case, the data was obtained from https://www.rottentomatoes.com/ and contains the Movie Title, Movie Rating, and Movie Review (text). The ratings and reviews were written and submitted by common users (not professional critics). Reviews were scraped from 100+ different movies so that we can get a wide variety of review content.

Contents of this repository:

* Python script used the scrape the data
* CSV file created by the python script (our dataset)
* Jupyter notebook with a simple NLP analysis predicting a user's rating based on their text review
