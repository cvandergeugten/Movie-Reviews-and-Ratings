Title,Rating,ReviewText
The Gray Man,2.5,"Two hours hard to finish. Ryan Gosling could be named as the new Cooler King, even in a bad movie. Chris Evans played a better sociopath in The Iceman."
The Gray Man,0.5,"Awful. So freakin awful! No character development. No background. No plot development.  Just, awful."
The Gray Man,2.5,Very boring for a spy film. Had high hopes for this film and did not live up at all.
The Gray Man,3,"What let this movie down was the casting of the Freddie Mercury character as the baddie. Every time he cam on screen I was expecting a rendition of 'We are the champions"""
The Gray Man,3,"This film is indeed quite stunning with strong and more realistic action, of course in accordance with the high cost of making it, but I think this film still has many shortcomings in terms of the plot aspect which is still relatively trivial, at the beginning of the screening it tends to be slow and boring and the conclusion which to me is quite disappointing should be more than just mediocre."
The Gray Man,4,Movie Rating: 8.5/10
The Gray Man,4,"Don't listen to the critics on this. Its a popcorn action movie that's surprisingly also well acted, especially Chris Evans in a hilarious evil role. No one is going to win award for this, it's just a fun watch with very good action scenes and scenery."
The Gray Man,1,"From the very beginning this movie is in explainer mode. If you like having everything explained to you while people kill each other, be my guest."
The Gray Man,5,Absolutely fantastic!
The Gray Man,5,"I loved this movie, but I noticed the critic review's are very low. The fight choreography was really innovative and well arranged. And all of the actors were great. Of course, Ryan Gosling going full John Wick on a bunch of bad guys is just great fun to watch. Critics must have lost their sense of enjoyment. Because I watch movies to be entertained. And this movie was highly entertaining. Critics got it wrong again. Maybe we don't need movie critics? LoL."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,5,Finally an original movie!  I though they didn't exist anymore.  This movie was fantastic.  So much fun and visually stunning.  This movie is super quirky but anyone would enjoy if they give it a chance.
Everything Everywhere All at Once,5,"A fost un film foarte bun, începutul a fost mai ciudat, dar la final totul a fost perfect construit"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,5,"I can't think of a movie that I've seen that I would recommend more- though always with a warning that it's best for fans of the weird and irreverent. I've never felt as much sameness with a character in media as I did with Waymond. ""This is how I fight."" I both laughed until my face hurt and cried real tears multiple times. This movie changed my perspective on life."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,0.5,"I really wanted to like this movie but I hated it. It felt messy, confused and like it was trying hard to be funny but failing. The wife wasn't likeable and the husband, who was likeable, was underused. I'm sure lots of people will like this film but it's definitely not for me."
X,5,"Visceral and eye-catching. I wanted to look away but kept getting dragged back in. As I have heard it before, ""texas chainsaw meets boogie-nights"" and it works."
X,3,"Love Ti West's first two horror features, House of the Devil and The Innkeepers. After that his stuff got very mediocre. A few years back he did his first non-horror outing, the western In a Valley of Violence, which was actually interesting and well made."
X,2.5,"Very pointless, felt like a lot of wasted potential in the name of randomness."
X,3,"""A black sheriff?"""
Us,3.5,"Can't really put my finger on why this film didn't do much for me, but it just didn't.  Overall I'd say it was good thanks to Peele's direction and there was definitely entertainment value there with the premise that was initially engaging.  The twist at the end unfortunately came at a point where I already felt apathetic towards the film for a good amount prior.  I might revisit this in the future, but I'm not in a hurry too.  Jordan Peele is a very interesting director regardless and I'll be looking forward to his future projects."
Us,4,"I had a really good time with the movie, tension high and maintained with some amazing visuals. I wasn't ever really super scared but the emotions and connections made while watching were superb."
Us,5,"Is Jordan peele, it can't be bad"
Us,5,If you don't like this film: you're not intelligent enough to understand it
Us,2.5,The plot didn't make much sense and it wasn't scary… but it did pass the time.
Us,2,"Very underwhelming. I was told it was really good, but when I watched it it was just good enough to pass the time."
Us,3.5,"It has it's flaws, but as I see it, this is an underrated horror film."
Get Out,4.5,"Easily Jordan Peele's best film to date.  The unsettling tone and atmosphere is well maintained throughout the picture from when Chris arrives at his girlfriend's family's home all the way to the very end.  The premise, performances, soundtrack, and 'twist' regarding what the Armitage family has been doing kept me hooked.  Never once did I lose interest or feel bored."
Get Out,5,In the mouth it was lovely
Get Out,4,"I find it interesting how this is regarded as the best Peele Horror movie and Nope typically considered the least, but in my opinion I think its reversed. I saw this movie after Nope, and the take-aways really come down to well, what you want to take away. In terms of a plot and story in which you can relate to, get out is extremely on point in every moment. But I feel like the scares are just less than his other movies. The dread is all present though."
Get Out,4.5,"It's a bit weird (I love weird movies btw) and the science they try to use is not well thought out, but it is a good movie.  I really enjoyed it on the first watch, I am not so sure I'll like it the second time since it is a good suspense and twist movie; I liked it enough to find out though and will be watching it again soon."
Get Out,5,Jordan Peele's best movie and a must watch
Get Out,5,Pay attention. Every detail is just perfect. So well put together
Get Out,4.5,Certainly Jordan Peele's first and greatest film yet. A much more straight forward and relatable plot to the real world compared to his other films.
Get Out,5,Loved this movie. So interesting!
Get Out,4.5,Written and directed by the amazing Jordan Peele!! So surprising!!
Get Out,5,Beautiful movie. Such a unique plot and such amazing characters and acting was completely outstanding. 10/10 horror film would 100% recommend
The Northman,0.5,"Considering the cast, subject material and reviews, I expected to enjoy this movie. But mostly I was bored. The pacing was atrocious. Most scenes were drawn out way too much. A boy stares out from a wall forever. Did we really need to watch the king ride all the way through the town? I understand the need to set a scene and introduce characters, but it doesn't take that long. It reminded me of those movies and shows where characters spend a long time doing mundane tasks like brushing their teeth. Pointless and boring. Then I looked up the director and understood why I disliked this movie. I don't care for his work. It's really sad because there have been so few movies I've looked forward to in recent years. That makes this one doubly disappointing."
The Northman,0.5,One of the worst movies I have ever watched!  I was expecting big things on the back of Vikings.
The Northman,1.5,This was truly awful. The film did a good job of showing Norse mythology and culture but it was too dark and way too many posed shots and looks and pretty much zero plot. The revenge was even sad and pathetic. Not surprisingly this film was an epic box office failure and that cannot be blamed on people not going to the theater. Nobody wanted to go to this movie.
The Northman,4,"Epic. With stellar performances and an interesting quest, this film will have you until the end. Possibly one of this year's best films. I'm not too familiar with Viking films, but I'm glad this one exists."
The Northman,1,"After watching the 1st two seasons of The Last Kingdom which I feel is the gold standard, the Northman falls well below par."
The Northman,3.5,"Well, this is complaining on an incredibly high level because it's definitely a little bit of a letdown for me after Eggers' incredible first two. It's (almost) as immersive as his previous movies, it's incredibly well made but it also has some distinct flaws. For a start, I hate the vaguely ""nordic"" accents the actors do, took me out of the moive a little from the beginning. I know this is a common trope in Hollywood movies but a filmmaker like Eggers should be better than this. Either go all in and do it all in ""Nordic"" with subs or let the actors speak normal english. It's silly and I always hate this ""english with accent"" nonsense. Apart from this minor thing, the movie is a bit hollow, i. e. it's basically all surface. Again, it's incrdibly well made but here's nothing in here that reflects upon the nature of revenge or the toxic masculinity on display here."
The Northman,2.5,Breathtaking visuals don't compensate for an ultimately boring tale with stunted dialogue and overuse of dream and vision sequences in place of the action you might reasonably expect. Disappointed that this is far from the epic saga foretold with actors that could do far more with it.
The Northman,1,"After reading the reviews on here, my love for anything vikings related and the beautiful Skarsgard, and not to mention the great cast, I decided to give this movie a try. After twenty to thirty minutes of watching I realized how terrible the movie was going to be. By the end I was just in absolute disbelief. While the sets and graphics were a admittedly fantastic - thus the reason for one start instead of half of a star - there should be other things involved in a good movie: a decent plot is the first thing that comes to mind. "
The Northman,5,"Brilliant movie, that depicts the plundering vikings as brutal and vicious, as they were without compromise, while at the same time subtly teaching audiences about the saga, that inspired the play Hamlet and giving a glimpse into their mythologie and culture, as good as it is possible in a movie."
The Northman,5,"If you have a taste for bloody violence and a stomach for brutality, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out. It's the original ""Hamlet"" story without the moral equivocating, showing both masculinity and femininity at their respective execrable worst and their glorious best."
The Batman,1.5,"Are we just going to ignore that the script was so bad at times that at times I thought it was a parody? I DO like that the Batman character is the moody, serious, tortured type. So he doesn't have to be Thor. BUT the script can't treat the audience like we're six years old. Details and plot pints that should be left for the reader to unravel / put the puzzle pieces together are simply stated by the characters.  Instead of me saying to myself ""ohhhh! That character is going to help someone else, because of X""… a character simply says ""you are going to help me, because of x"".  There is a cipher used repeatedly, yet the audience (and the characters, apparently) have to do no actual work to solve it. It just gets solved instantly!"
The Batman,3,"I did not expect much and I certainly did not get it. Not a Christopher Nolan masterpiece or a Tim Burton romp. Not sure why this was made. With a star (Robert Pattinson) who clearly had no energy due to Covid the co stars, especially Zoe Kravitz and Andy Serkis,helped to lift the film. It had a nice film noir feel to it and the characters had their one-liners. I am glad I saw it at home."
The Batman,4.5,One of the best takes on the caped crusader yet. Very long but worth every second. And every performance is phenomenal; Paul Dano's take on the riddler is breathtaking every scene and Robert Pattinson's extra glum Batman may be the best interpretation of the dark knight yet.
The Batman,0.5,"This movie was the greatest insult to Batman since Bat-nipples. There was a scene in this movie where Batman chases penguin down a highway, creates a fifteen car pileup that explodes and probably kills at least a dozen people, just so that Penguin can give Batman a Spanish lesson."
The Batman,5,10/10 a near-perfect film
The Batman,5,People do know that this is the first year's of batman when he was beginning the process of the night crusader. If you don't fuck off because your you don't know anything about Batman lore.
The Batman,0.5,"Man I'm sick of the BatMisery that we have here and had with Nolan. 89 Bats is far better then anything we've had since. DC movies are so busy trying to be edgy and dark that that loose any trace of what comic book movies need, fun! Humour! Escapism!!"
The Batman,5,Pattinson is the best batman on film
The Batman,5,I have no words. So pleasing to watch
The Batman,5,"I have never seen such a great batman movie in all of my life. When the dark knight came out, I thought that there couldn't be anything better. I was wrong. Matt Reeves created a much darker and more realistic Gotham than really any other version of Gotham. He also explored new area for characters such as the Riddler. Robert Pattinson may have disgraced himself in the twilight movies, but he totally redeemed himself."
Leave No Trace,4,"A sweet movie about a father and daughter, love and acceptance."
Leave No Trace,1.5,"Boring movie, not and interesting subject"
Leave No Trace,5,Excellent movie! Foster and McKenzie are brilliant! This movie should have won every award available.
Leave No Trace,5,"Slow and quiet, beautiful and sad."
Leave No Trace,3.5,Worth a watch. Has convincing performances by the lead actors.
Leave No Trace,5,"tense great movie, will keep you on your toes! very very good acting."
Leave No Trace,5,"Ben Foster and Thom make an amazingly emotional movie with very little dialogue. No bad guys, just people trying to make it in a tough world."
Leave No Trace,4,"Sad, yet beautiful.       "
Last Night in Soho,4.5,"The visuals were stunning, the characters were interesting and the way it ended made my socks drop right off. I thought I'd called the twist, but then the twist was better than I expected. And the final scene at the end was a breath of fresh air."
Last Night in Soho,3,"This movie is a near miss for me. It is by no means bad, I just had higher hopes. I love the 60s aesthetic, the fashion, the music, the hairstyles. So when I saw this previewed I was all in.  I stopped watching on HBO about halfway in.  Something about it wasn't clicking with me. Too slow maybe? I came back a couple of days later and finished it. I thought it was going to be too predictable but I was certainly wrong there. I won't give any spoilers but I didn't see the end coming. No, that wasn't my problem.  It was the repetition of the heroine's response to her problem. The mindlessly fleeing into the streets three different times. The reaction she had right at the end was also confusing. Not in a I-didn't-understand way but a why-did-the-director-do-that? way.  Again, I don't want to wave anyone off from this movie. It is not bad. But if you're looking for a sympathetic main character (who actually does come off a bit crazy) or a revisit to Soho in the 60s it's not going to happen."
Last Night in Soho,3.5,"The visuals and acting are great but the threat felt lacking. I really want to say that it's out of this world, but I feel like more fear needed to be added. It all made sense and the plot was great, just needed a little more scary in this movie."
Last Night in Soho,1,"If I understood better what type of movie it was, I wouldn't have watched.  Definitely not my genre.  But I did watch so I must rate it.  It's unbelievably bad.  Just when I thought it couldn't get more ludicrous and heavy-handed, something even more idiotic happened.  Then again.  Then again.  Clumsy.  Shallow.  2.4 out of 10."
Last Night in Soho,3,"I was disappointed in this, and I love everything else Edgar Wright has done. There was something meandering and pointless to this whole story, and the supposed twists were predictable even without there being a decent foreshadowing. If you are going to swing a big ""who dunnit"" you have to lay the groundwork that makes it obvious upon retrospect, and while the motivation is clearly there, there is such a messy ""red"" herring (get it?) to make it look like ""someone else dunnit"" that the reveal felt cheap. The audience had been lied to, and that undermines the whole point of the movie."
Last Night in Soho,5,Exceeded every expectation.
Last Night in Soho,3,"It's very beatiful and has good performances, but has a very weak story and disapointing plot"
Last Night in Soho,1,"Do not be fooled by the trailer, this movie was written by someone trippin on acid.  The story is hard to follow and the characters are forgettable all the way to the end when the movie jumps shark."
Last Night in Soho,4,Love the editing and cinematography! Kinda predicted the ending though.
Last Night in Soho,3,"Starts out strong, but then just gets weird. Once it decides it wants to be a scary movie it doesn't really succeed. Both lead actresses were great, but the story just doesn't finish strongly. when it's over tou just kind of say "" allrighty"". Don't Bother"
The Lost City,3.5,"Entertaining enough.  I like both of the lead actors and they did a good job in roles that are somewhat their 'sweet spot'.  Certainly not 'high cinema, but a nice break from serious stuff."
The Lost City,3,"While the adventure isn't as appealing and not all the humour lands, the chemistry between the two leads carries it across the finish line."
The Lost City,3,"It's pretty typical "" Indiana Jones "" . But , it was fun for me ."
The Lost City,2,"I like Sandra Bullock and she is appealing and likable in this; however, it is silly and almost unwatchable.   This is filled with sight gags and cheap laughs."
The Lost City,1.5,"I should have watched the trailer. It is too silly/comical/weird for my taste, but the trailer does give fair warning. In all fairness I should mention that I only watched 10-15 minutes."
The Lost City,4.5,A fun and hilarious film that we all enjoyed. Brad Pitts character was excellent but we wish he had lasted longer in the film. Almost didnt recognise Daniel Radcliffe as an excellent baddie. A good light hearted film and Sandra Bullock was also stunning.
The Lost City,4.5,"great!!! made me laugh, adventure and romance..."
Uncharted,5,Tom Holland is spectacular and Mark Wahlberg does not fail to impress. The action sequences are fresh not overdone and impossible. Loved this movie 🍿
Uncharted,3.5,pochoclera nada del otro mundo entretenida para disfrutar en familia
Uncharted,2,"This is not a good movie. It is watchable but... there is very little clever or interesting going on, all of the main leads were very annoying (Mark Wahlberg was the most likeable which is saying something), there were no stakes, there was casual killing that seemed to mean nothing, a murderer was beaten in a fight and in the next scene had just disappeared, things that made no sense such as an ancient hidden cavern with direct access via a stormwater drain, hidden passages with open access to nightclubs, the only twists were the random switches of allegiances, characters did really dumb things such as taking their boat directly past the location where they knew the murderer would be, etc, etc. Very annoying,"
Uncharted,4,"I liked the movie, it remind me of the videogames, I was excited by the cast, but I got sad about this ""Jo"", it could've easily been Nadine u.u"
Uncharted,3.5,"It's just another movie of adventure, I mean is really funny and for sure you will have a good time but if you are expecting something new and refreshing this is not the movie you are looking for."
Uncharted,3.5,"Honestly while this movie certainly isn't critical masterpiece, It is really fun and does a decent job capturing everything that makes the games so popular. First I think Tom Holland was a good choice to play a young (very naive) version of Nathan Drake. Mark Wahlberg played to his strengths in this role. The one that stood out to me the most was Tati Gabrielle as Jo, Im not familiar with anything she has been in other than this film so I dont know if she's really good at playing cool or if she in real is just that cool. I thought she was a fantastic villain, she was scary, seductive, vengeful, capable, ambitious, jealous like I could see her being the next Bond Villain she was just so cool. Didnt really like Sophia Ali's version of Chloe Frazer, the australian accent was a little harsh at times and her version of Chloe was a lot more selfish, dry and generic than I remember from the games. Games have more time to develop characters so I give this a bit of a pass.A couple of scenes in the film were just physically ridiculous, like theres is no way anybody could slap into a giant cargo container while falling out of a plane and survive, but thats how the video game is so I actually found that to be kind of funny. the movie is pretty campy and ridiculous at times but its really fun and held together by some really good"
Uncharted,5,Excellent movie. Lots of action and fun the way I like it!
Uncharted,2,"Sorry. Tom and Mark are fantastic talents, but this story, the character portrayals and overall experience feel quite pale to actually playing the video game. That sounds impossible, but the very first Uncharted game, Drakes Fortune, was like watching a great adventure film while being part of the story.  It was unforgettable, unlike this film.  This film should have been epic. Too bad."
Uncharted,3.5,A franchise of fun was born. Uncharted is a full-on action packed gold rush. Excellent special effects give this joy ride the muscle it needs. Effortless work by Mark and Tom makes the viewing experience familiar.
Uncharted,2,"A good cast and decent production is not enough to offset a poor script and a story that just cannot decide what it wants to be. Holland and Wahlberg are great together and their charm eases viewers into the film during its first act, but then turns into a kind of ""romancing the stone"" with Holland and Ali during the second act. Then Ali disappears and Wahlberg is back again for the implausible and unconvincing third act in which Holland is suddenly dodging bullets and outsmarting professional killers.  Meanwhile, Gabrielle and Banderas make for good antagonists but get little screen time. Ultimately a production let down by its creators who couldn't decide what kind of movie they wanted to make."
House of Gucci,4,"Good direction, good actors and very interesting story!"
House of Gucci,3.5,"Not the greatest Scott movie, but not disappointing. Good entertainment, excellent photography and art design. A beautiful reflection of the fashion world that the movie portrays. There is a kind of soap opera style in the narrative, sometimes even grotesque due to Jared Leto's performance, but I guess that was intentional and fits the story very well. Same as the combination of opera and pop music."
House of Gucci,3,"Despite it being nearly 3 hours long, Gaga's acting truly reeled me in and kept me watching. Eitherway, the movie was fine to have on in the background but I couldn't imagine being fully focused on it all the time. The story was interesting."
House of Gucci,4,"In this age of schlocky superhero movies ad nauseum, it's good to see an epic by a great director such as Ridley Scott. The entire cast was superb."
House of Gucci,2.5,This is really awful. Sorry. I wish I could compliment Gaga and Driver etc but it was just awful.
House of Gucci,5,Very good drama. Great acting.
House of Gucci,2,Unengaging.  Gaga's performance was forced and it shows.  Scott hasn't anything good for a long time.
House of Gucci,2.5,"I enjoyed the actors' performances, but frankly couldn't take the movie seriously. My #1 question is why they didn't use Italian actors. This fact alone made the whole movie too trite and made me lose interest. The character played by Jared Leto just made the whole movie farcical. The movie could have been much more engaging if done in the style of Wertmuller or De Sica."
House of Gucci,4,Much better than I thought it would be. Rather excellent and not infected with any Hollywood weird stuff. I understand some of the timelines are factually incorrect but overall it was thoroughly entertaining.
House of Gucci,4,"Lady Gaga and Adam Driver were quite good. The supporting cast was as well, especially Leto. I'm not sure I'd watch it numerous times, but I liked it overall."
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,2,The characters all act completely different from previous movies. None of the movies in this trilogy feel connected at all
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,2.5,Just overblown CGI nonsense.
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,4.5,"I really enjoyed this movie. So much so I watched it twice in the cinema. I'm not usually one to be hyped up over a Harry Potter movie, but this one managed to catch my attention with it's acting, story and visuals. Would recommend for sure! Just watch the movie!"
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,3.5,Keeping the same from the previous one
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,2,"I was surprised how bad this movie was considering how much I enjoyed its predecessors and the abilities of most of the actors in it. Jessica Williams didn't seem as accomplished as the other main actors and that dragged it down some but generally I think the lines were just poorly written. The Dumbledore character is so far removed from the Harry Potter Dumbledore that I struggle to believe it's the same person. He says and does things that just don't fit the character, even considering his youth. The movie was slow and uneventful, lacking in energy and action. Even though it contained snippets of magic, it didn't seem very magical. Some plot points, like the illness Clarence was suffering from, weren't explained at all. There was no real build up and the obligatory final battle between good and evil was extremely lackluster and didn't make a lot of sense. Even the CG was bad. The first Fantastic Beasts movie was good and second was amazing. Maybe they thought that momentum would carry them through without needing to invest any actual energy but it definitely didn't. I was very disappointed."
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,4,"I haven't really cared much for the prior Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films, but I really thought this one was great. Some of the characters really drew me in, and I found the plot, action, and world building way more interesting this time."
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,1,"Killing and slaughtering, not one, but TWO beautiful creatures during the first twenty minutes spoiled the rest of the movie.  I understand that it was done to set the tone of the movie.  It could have been done differently.  The entire movie felt dark and foreboding.  I can't recall one scene which felt warm and fuzzy, like we'd gotten used to with some of the previous installments and and with the HP franchise.  The special effect were great, with more of the same and nothing new.  Felt like they tried very hard to make it feel like a Hollywood action blockbuster.  Explosions, chase scenes, explosions and more explosions.  Where was the magic and fantasy?  The political thriller undertones had no place in a movie that was supposed to to be about magic and fantasy.  If the fourth installment is anything like this one, then i can honestly say ' BORING, MOVING ON"
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,4.5,"A welcome addition to the Fantastic Beasts franchise. With amazing visual tricks, spectacular beasts, and good humor, Jude Law pulls you into an adventure that looks phenomenal and keeps you entranced. The only noticeable fault is the absence of Johnny Depp, however, Mads Mikkelsen plays the role of Grindelwald in his own way and comes off as powerful and scary as the character is known for. All in all, a very fun film."
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,4,I thought it was the best story line of the series.  Evil villain and corruption.  Closer to what you expect from the Harry Potter franchise.
The Outfit,4,"The play on words title is just the start of the fun. Gangland threats and shootings, mysterious pasts, betrayals and odd alliances in a setting more like a stage play than a movie. Our narrator/ protagonist shows off his stage background with poise and grace. Can there be too many plot twists? Me thinks not. Cleverly written, wonderfully staged and brilliantly executed. A well spent and satisfying whodunit."
The Outfit,2.5,"A well done single location, maybe due to covid, crime film. Was glad Dylan O'Brien wasn't around for long cause his Chicago accent was ruining things for me. A Few too many twists and inconsistencies."
The Outfit,4,A thinking person's movie.  More twists than a taylor's knot.  Artfully underplayed to perfection.  A who done it that keeps you guessing.
The Outfit,5,"I seen the trailer a few times and knew that it was gonna be such a good movie, and indeed it was. The plot was everything and I mean the suspense kept me on my toes. I would think one thing and it came out wrong. The ending was good and it wrapped up everything quite well. The characters were everything and actors and actresses did they job."
The Outfit,3,"Sort of like a play, i.e., talky and limited to one inside location, but it's at least a movie for adults for a change"
The Outfit,4,"All the makings of a great thriller, this is a clever, witty, and well-acted piece of film. An efficient and exciting story and cast make for a surprisingly solid experience."
The Outfit,5,"What happens when you mix Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with 1950's crime films: An amazing film called The Outfit. The Outfit tells the story of a tailor (or cutter) who make suits for gangster. The movie has amazing cast, particularly Mark Rylance, the cinematography, the score, the script and the unexpected twists. I have nothing but good things about this film. Overall, The Outfit kicks off 2022 with a bang."
The Outfit,5,2022 Oscar Best Actor = Mark Rylance!!
The Outfit,5,Stunning.. Classy.. good music score. You do have to pay attention to script as it moves so fast.. I could watch 50 more times.....
The Outfit,5,"Love this kind of crime movie where it shows you don't need much as long as you have a great story. Great directing, casting, acting, and writing overall!"
Eternals,4.5,Excellent movie and a magnificent adventure.
The Bad Guys,5,"The Bad Guys is an absolutely amazing movie. Clever Dialogue and character dynamics make for a wildly fun time. With enough twist and turns to keep movie goers of all ages entertained. A crisp animation style that is second only to Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. The reason this movie continues to hold my intrigue is because, unlike so many other recent movies, it gets better the more I think about it. The best animated movie to come out this year."
The Bad Guys,4,"Between the inspired animated style under instant appeal and the cast charismatically adding into that entertainment value by solidly written, wholesome fulfillment with radiated fun energy stylishly expressing the hefty heart and laughable zanily comedy, this is a grateful delight in a renaissance embrace for Dreamworks attempting to reconnect their original roots whereas the older audience can also enjoy what an animated film truly has to offer. (B+)"
The Bad Guys,3,"Enjoyed the animation and the premise, good performances all around and a nice tidy story."
The Bad Guys,3,"Beautiful, unique animation. It has its fun, at times. However, predictable and sometimes charmless and unlikable."
The Bad Guys,4,"This movie is kind, sweet, and well made. Overall it has a good message about breaking from stereotypes and is a fun movie that all ages can enjoy!"
The Bad Guys,4,Rockwell leads a fantastic cast with beautiful animation. The story is fun and can be enjoyed by the whole family.
The Bad Guys,4.5,A great movie.  I laughed a lot while watching it.
The Bad Guys,3.5,Rating: B
The Bad Guys,4,"It may not be for All adults, but family oriented viewers and animation lovers will have a blast with its schemes and humor."
The Bad Guys,5,This. is. great. Entertaining story. Captivating visuals. Fun characters. YES!
The Rental,3.5,"Everything wrong becomes worst in the kitchen sink, it's was much fun... This will jinks you in your next Airbnb..."
The Rental,0.5,Forgettable caractères for a useless story. Really uncomfortable.
The Rental,2.5,"Not so scary and not so gory. Is a bit slow at first but ramps up a bit towards the end. Wished for more slashing at least, but didn't deliver on that front either even though there's the expected killing spree at the end."
The Rental,5,"Excellent movie that slowly builds the tension and then the film flips into a whole other movie on the last 30mins. This was an excellent film and how horror should be done. Reading a lot of the reviews I see the audience doesn't understand the concept. We're not supposed to sympathize with the Irish girl, she's a super sensitive woke, lying, cheater. The director's intent is addressing the racial tension that can happen inadvertently when you are in these situations."
The Rental,3.5,"Ironically, the character who were supposed to sympathize with for being ""discriminated against"" is the most toxic character in the entire film. It is however an excellent portrayal of reverse stereotypes, where the ""racist pervert white man"" was just a guy doing his job as people around him self-victimize and desperately try to cover their secrets.  Some nice twists though regardless, and the ending is unexpectedly satisfying."
The Rental,3,"The Rental was a good enough time. It starts off as a slow-burn thriller and works its way towards being a full-bore slasher in the end. None of the performances will blow your lid and the plot is definitely ripped from the headlines, but it is a worthwhile week night watch for a few cheap scares."
The Rental,0.5,"Feels like James Franco took superficial things from other horror movies and glued them onto a random anticlimactic plot. Like, it's found footage, about kids in a cabin in the woods, who accidentally kill a guy while on vacation, and when the killer appears, for some reason he's wearing a latex mask and invincible (like Michael Myers/Jason). There's also lots of iconic horror movie shots/scenes used, that don't make sense or go anywhere."
The Rental,2,"I couldn't make it more than 20 min. The ""everyone is racist and they are out to getcha"" trope is just becoming tiresome. Makes the movie seem like it's from a different dimension as 99.9% of people don't care about race."
The Rental,5,This movie was amazing and it really made me think of how creepy and weird people really are.
Avengers: Endgame,3.5,its good enough for me to watch it twice enjoyable just I didnt like the start or the middle that much finnal battle is a banger tho
Avengers: Endgame,5,"WOW! JUST WOW! Being a Marvel fan for all my life, this was just too satisfying to watch. Brilliantly made film with great CGI and an epic battle to finish this epic saga."
Avengers: Endgame,5,"Probably, in general, the greatest film of all time, everyone comes together for the final battle of Marvel's world-shattering Infinity Saga. It's not only everyone in the MCU, but also everyone in real life--audiences were blown away by the moments in this movie and the incredible emotional impact it left on its dedicated fans. It's a cinematic achievement that may never be achieved again, one that deserves to be learned about in history class."
Avengers: Endgame,5,"The build-up of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has all come down to this. The hype around this movie was well deserved as we got an amazing end to the Infinity Saga. Seeing character developments come to a perfect end, this movie hits all the rights notes in terms of battles, visual effects, emotions, jokes, and the fun that Marvel is known for. One of the best Marvel movies of all time and is sure to hold up for a long time. No doubt that Avengers: Endgame has assembled 5 stars"
Avengers: Endgame,4,My rating for the film is a 8.9/10
Avengers: Endgame,5,"Completamente impactante, un cierre excepcional para algunos personajes y un perfecto inicio para las próximas entregas."
Avengers: Endgame,4.5,"I think this movie came with many expectations, and i personally stay with this one of all the 20 something movies from the MCU; this movie has it ALL. Everytime i watch this movie, i feel marvel took it personal, and that is something big for me, like they did after with Spiderman: No way home."
Avengers: Endgame,5,"This movie is just the perfect ending to 10 years movie mega project. ""EPIC"" is the only word that can describe this movie"
Avengers: Endgame,5,very sad butt epic movie 
Avengers: Endgame,5,Best movie ever made. That was amazing. Oh my god that is my favorite movie of all time. Brought to tars a million times. The most epic movie ever 100000/10 you have to watch it. Cry every time
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,5,I legit would do ANYTHING to see this shit
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,3.5,Spoilers
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,2,"CG are good, but the movie is really boring overall. In addition to that Mandarin is a really dumb villain for being a thousand years old."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,3.5,"Overall a solid movie, has good humor ,action and cast"
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,5,"A must see indeed, but the last act feels really weird to watch, almost like it wasn't made with the rest of the movie. Everything else is 10/10 but the special effects of the last act are just lack-luster. Doesn't detract from the rating because everything else hits the nail, action, comedy, visuals. But that last bit, something was up."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,5,Great storyline. Such good acting that all the cast have delivered.
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,5,"The first Asian-led MCU title is an incredible one. The superhero origin takes the original Marvel backstory formula, but adds more to make it incredibly interesting. It's an extremely entertaining ride, with incredible casting, creative settings, and stellar visual effects. Shang-Chi is sure to be the next great Marvel hero."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,0.5,This was just so unexpectedly BAD. OMG what is happening with MCU?
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,5,Fantastic! One of the best MCU movies yet!
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,4.5,A marvel movie done right. A very great origin story that is packed with action and humour. This movie is able to maintain the viewers interest throughout the whole time. The visual effects are insane and satisfying to watch. This movie has one of the best fight scenes in the mcu. Finally a great hero origin story.
The Father,5,"A fantastically realistic view into the mind of someone suffering from dementia. It invites the audience to experience the confusing and scary world of a slipping mind. The imperceptible set changes and outstanding performances only strengthen the audience's foray into the suffering of the afflicted, and their loved ones. Anthony Hopkins at his finest. Bravo!"
The Father,5,"An absolutely magnificent film that explores the last days of a man who is losing his way in the world. The people surrounding him are kind but, for him, interchangeable and often unrecognisable. A completely compelling performance by one of the 20th and 21st centuries' most talented actors. It was a privilege to see this movie."
The Father,5,"Poignant, unnerving, horrifically sad but probably the best film I've watched in a long time. Exceptionally well executed by all, not least the stellar cast. Not an easy watch but a must see none the less."
The Father,5,"As emotionally dramatic as it gets. The film is brilliant with all the cast on top form, but Anthony Hopkins simply superb as a man sinking in his dementia."
The Father,4.5,Uma experiência real em forma de filme de como a vida de uma pessoa com alzheimer.
The Father,5,"Absolutely brilliant, the way in which Alzheimer's and old age were worked out, forgetfulness and mental confusion are felt not only by the protagonist but also by the audience, it's something that certainly approaches perfection."
The Father,4,"Emotional and at times painful, this movie is led by strong performances from its 2 lead actors, especially Hopkins. The depiction of what old people go through, is what makes this painful to watch, in an empathetic way."
The Father,3.5,Anthony Hopkins once again proves that he is one of the greatest actors ever.
The Father,3.5,Interessante abordagem de um tema complexo como a demência brindado com mais uma grande atuação do Anthony Hopkins
The Father,4.5,If you only thought Hopkins peaked at Silence of the Lambs or being Thor's dad.
Don't Look Up,5,This is some enjoyable level satire with star actors which really captured the feeling of beeing a young and educated human in a self destructive capitalisitc world.
Don't Look Up,0.5,Blatant liberal propganda
Don't Look Up,5,"Buena crítica a la sociedad actual. A esas cosas que no son esenciales pero que tienen mucha importancia y relevancia en la actualidad, dejando de lado temas importantes."
Don't Look Up,4.5,A great dark comedy.
Don't Look Up,3.5,"Definitely better than the reviews would have you believe. Don't Look Up has a collection of talent that could have made one of the all-time great satires and perhaps the disappointment is that it doesn't do so. However, it is still quite good. More than its entertainment factor - and it is entertaining - it is a timely and compelling wrecking ball that is meant to crash through our walls of collective denial. Of course, we will ignore it and time might sadly make this movie appear more and more prophetic."
Don't Look Up,5,The movie portrays the insanity we are already living in with climate denial. It's a very relatable movie.
Don't Look Up,4,I think no one are going to watch this movie without overthink about the reflection that it has on society and human beings matters.
Don't Look Up,3.5,"Very realistic depiction of the current situation, I would've preferred if they made the disaster a manmade one rather than a random natural thing."
Don't Look Up,5,Well done. An inflated view of current society.
Don't Look Up,0.5,From bad camera angles to bad actors this movie is horrible. I had more enjoyment getting a root canal or speeding ticket.
Thor: Ragnarok,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 10 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!! It is not ****ing bull****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The bad reviews can lick a p***y and c***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thor: Ragnarok,4.5,Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast have great chemistry in this movie. The storyline and comedy are well written.
Thor: Ragnarok,4.5,"This movie got the right balance of story, plot, humor, action, and drama.  It is by far the best Thor movie and enjoyable to watch as a stand alone"
Thor: Ragnarok,4.5,Fun movie with lots of jokes
Thor: Ragnarok,5,"Taika Waititi swoops in at just the right moment to save Thor in the MCU. One of the funniest MCU films to date, it blew audiences away all around the world, completely reinventing the formula, and giving Thor the re-work that was required after his somewhat disastrous second movie. WIth amazing characters and an amazing cast, Thor: Ragnarok is a magnificent achievement in cinema."
Thor: Ragnarok,4,My rating for the film is a 8.6/10
Thor: Ragnarok,5,"Thor: Ragnarok is the BEST Thor movie. I've seen all of them. Thor (2011), Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Ragnarok wasn't too serious, but it wasn't too funny. It had just the right amount of humor and seriousness to balance it out."
Thor: Ragnarok,4.5,My 2nd favorite Marvel movie great execution amazing at the sequel was so terrible in comparison
Thor: Ragnarok,2,"Regia scarsa, per un film senza né capo né coda."
Thor: Ragnarok,5,Quite the tone change compared to the first two movies. This was really fun.
Black Panther,3,Extremely overrated and I am definitely not a huge fan of it.
Black Panther,5,"The first Black-led superhero film in the MCU's long line of installments proves to be one that will never lose its momentum. While being review-bombed by incels who believe that having a Black lead makes a film ""woke"", it survives completely thanks to its brilliant visuals, characters, down-to-earthness, and plot. Watch out world--T'Challa is claiming his rightful throne!"
Black Panther,4,My rating for the film is a 8.3/10
Black Panther,5,Oh my godness love it. Best marvel movie fr. It makes in a way that no other does.
Black Panther,4,"This movie is different than many in the MCU. It deals with an entire nation, with a special access to resources and technologies based on those resources. The idea that this nation has kept it's true capabilities a secret is interesting, and the movie manages to pull off an acceptable level of credibility. Enough for me to enjoy the movie at any rate."
Black Panther,2,This is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen considering it's high praise I praise it certainly did not live up to any of those expectations a very mediocre film at best with thei'm at best with very cringy corny CGI
Black Panther,2.5,It took 3 attempts to actually be able to see the whole movie.  The story was so engaging I fell asleep the first two times.  Overall it was solidly in the middle of the pack of Marvel movies
Black Panther,4,"The movie is  awesome. It was colorful , loads of action and a few humor in the movie. It was so good I watched it multiple times"
Black Panther,5,Loved it. We miss you black panther.
Black Panther,2,i didnt like so much CGI was not great and it didnt really have a good story
The Power of the Dog,0.5,"Whatever they were trying to get at, they never got to it. Start with an awful, annoying and distracting music score, and hey listen, any time you notice as a viewer, how out-of-place and bad the music is, you've already blown it. I could never follow along or figure out what the point was, the entire 2hrs 5 min movie just floundered around aimlessly. Character studies are fine as long as there are relatable characters and a regular human being can figure them out, I couldn't figure any of these characters out or what their roles were.  Never have I seen such confused characters in a film, every single character was unrelatable, and unlikable.   Completely ""huh??"" scenes everywhere. What on God's green earth was that scene in the meadow with Phil lying in the grass slowly massaging sensuously some cloth over his face and in the air. Just when you start to pull for Pete, the underdog, he dissects a bunny in his room. Lousy and anti-climatic ending, and what's with the emasculating of the men in this film, who wants to see any of that? Was THAT the point? Very poor and very weird movie. This was the worst movie I've seen in twenty years, and it won an Oscar for Best Director. How?? This film is completely disorganized! If the woman (Jane Campion) is that good, I cannot imagine how bad this film could have REALLY been. Scenery is excellent so there is the one-half star."
The Power of the Dog,5,"The quiet, subtle, intense performances of everyone in this film was riveting in the quietest of ways. Folks complaining about ""that's not Montana"" have quite clearly never been in the vast majority of that great state. Score was unnerving and masterful. And more happens in this film than in all phase-4 Marvel movies combined. Anyone that thinks otherwise can't see a dog in the mountain."
The Power of the Dog,0.5,"Possibly one of the most overrated films of all time. The acting was hokey, the story was tortuously boring, the payoff was weak. The only thing good here was the beautiful cinematography. Why it was shot in New Zealand is confusing to me. I mean Montana exits. "
The Power of the Dog,4,"More compelling than I anticipated.  The sets, costumes, and cinematography all add to the storytelling without distracting from it, which isn't a given with historical films.  The main characters are refreshingly nuanced, including the antagonist."
The Power of the Dog,0.5,"The acting was good, but the story was insanity from beginning to end. Terrible"
The Power of the Dog,1,This movie was very slow. I kept waiting for something to happen.
The Power of the Dog,2.5,"A film made for critics, not us plebians."
The Power of the Dog,0.5,"Why do ""the critics"" love this? Because they loved The Piano. If this came to us without the Campion stamp, this would be seen for what it is: boring, poorly directed, over- and under-acted (Jesse Plemons perfects the art of not being), cliched, incoherent, filled with stereotypes of gay men, women, ""cowboys"", the so-called West. The ""bitch"" was right in one point: where are the real cowboys, meaning cowfamilies who actually ran these ranches? The WOMEN who ran the whole thing? How does Rose go from dry to drunk? How is a single mother who runs her own business crushed by an absurd character such as Phil, overacted (poorly directed) by a great actor in Cumberbatch? Not one of these characters is real or sympathetic. The one gay man is an absurd stereotype (in chaps all the time no less! It's fun to stay at the fake Montana!) and the other character, Peter, who may or may not be gay, is simply a serial killer being formed, first by killing coldly a rabbit (there is no real sign he is going to medical school -- though cliche cliche he might be a budding florist! -- in his future and almost all serial killers start on animals) and then by killing coldly another human and made the hero who saves his mommy. What, no putting him in a dress like in Psycho? I think most viewers, if honest, will admit they had to try several times to finally slog through this predictable, dreary, fundamentally cliched and simplistic bore."
The Power of the Dog,3,Honestly thought this was going to be critically panned and am really surprised now that im here reading glowing reviews of this incredibly predictable and lazy take
The Power of the Dog,3.5,"A beautiful revisionist western with solid performances, maybe Cumberbatch overacting here and there, and an incredible atmospheric soundtrack. Presenting a good amount of well-crafted ambiguity to the characters' thoughts and actions. This creates a very surprising and enthralling narrative about a power dynamic and, I guess, masculinity. Maybe even a toxic one that people can not stop writing about. I don't think so, because who out of Peter and Phil was the bigger sociopath and more of a menace is really not that definitive. One glaring hole in the script, and by extension, in the character, is Rose. It is really hard to accept her poorly paced spiral into alcoholism because of her circumstances or Phil's presence. Or rather, it would have been easy if the adaptation kept that singular fact that Phil is partially responsible for her late husband's suicide. Yes, that would add to an argument for taking down Phil. I'm sure they just wanted to keep the ambiguity, like whether Bronco and Phil were truly lovers or not. Was he grooming Peter just like Bronco groomed him? Was it all just a big cycle of sodomy broken by someone Phil utterly underestimated? Whatever the answers may be, this is a very fine movie."
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,3.5,Good movie although got a bit of filler
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,4,difference between paramount and disgusting netflix
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,3.5,"Not as good as the first movie but still worth the watch for sure. Much like many movies of our time there are a lot of ""funny"" moments that fall flat."
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,5,"I even liked the parts with the humans, cause they were pretty funny to be honest. The only part im like, ehhhh, is the dance-off, that felt pretty weird. But oh well."
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,4,Reached out to my expectations. Fairly.
Dune,3.5,Trying to put it to words.
Dune,4.5,This is the best adaptation yet.  I hope they keep going with it and I get to see many more books in the series portrayed.
Dune,4,Questo film rappresenta la speranza che il cinema di intrattenimento e di alto livello possano ancora giocare un ruolo importante.
Dune,2.5,"Im conflicted about this film. I think Denis is a brilliant filmmaker i mean Arrival still stands as one of my favorite films ive seen. But this film just didnt really do it for me. Starting with the positives its beautifully filmed. Every shot, every set, and every costume is visually spectacular... The special effects are also spectacular the shields, the bombs, the worm were all amazingly well done with visual effects... Now to the negatives... I felt like this movie dragged a lot... I appreciate that Denis is dedicated to a show-not-tell approach to film, but this movie has so many mundane scenes that feel so senselessly prolonged... fat guy floating through the air, fat guy swimming in mud, man watering trees, old woman talking in a deep voice, Lady Jessica having a nervous breakdown, a lot of rich people standing around in cool clothes... this movie was not as thrilling or as captivating as I thought it was going to be. and I love Timothee Chalamet I think hes a great actor, but I didnt really vibe with his angsty version of Paul It felt a little too Green Day/Fall Out Boy to me."
Dune,3.5,"Not bad, great visuals, and the direction of the story was good. A bit boring though. I hate when they make a movie and it feels unfinished like they planned a trilogy and just gave us one part of a story instead of a complete story."
Dune,3,"Ponderous, serious, looooong. Great cinematography."
12 Strong,3,"Okay, so points given that this is the depiction of a real life event. "
12 Strong,5,"I enjoyed this movie and gave it my 100% attention otherwise I would have missed some key points. The honesty, love, affection, and respect that was exuded between Hemsworth's character and his real wife, Elsa Pataky, was beautiful to behold. Their chemistry was spot on!! Also, the friendship, loyalty, and bravery among the 12 soldiers really touched my soul. Hemsworth need not worry about being typecast because he is such a versatile actor. I love movies that are based on true events. Great job!"
12 Strong,3.5,"Lots of potential, but it fell flat.  There is enough action to get through the night, but I fell it could have been better."
12 Strong,3.5,"The general was right, the victory didn't matter. Eventually the Americams left and the Taliban went back to its torture, abuse, and dominance."
12 Strong,3,"Gets the job done, and does it pretty well. Hemsworth and Shannon are good. Negabhan is really good. Acar doesn't really do anything but he looks cool. This isn't American Sniper and it certainly isn't Saving Private Ryan, but it is a thrilling war movie that has awesome shots of commandos riding on horseback with machine guns. Also it's evidently based on a true story? Cool. But bottom line, I just wanna see Negabhan and Acar in more things."
12 Strong,4,I enjoyed this true-life story as it showed the US military effort that went into attacking the Taliban in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. Good cast & good storyline that was approved by the real men in this battle
12 Strong,3.5,A solid performance from Chris Hemsworth and a great adaption of a true story
12 Strong,5,I watched it with my dad great film watch it now George bush.
12 Strong,3,"Minha opinião: Um filme estrelado por atores de renomes Chris, Michael, willian, Michael,..... É um filme de guerra que este esquadrão vai para o Afeganistão logo após os atentados de 11 de Setembro nos EUA. Ai foi como mexer em um vespeiro. E este 1º esquadrão teve seus objetivos traçados, ajudar uma tribo que guerreia contra o Talibã a vencer e destroir o inimigo. Onde Chris e o líder do esquadrão que deve vencer este desafio e abrir caminho as outras incursões dos EUA contra o Talibã. A 1ª barreira além da lingugem e a diferença de cultura e de proposito e também a diferença na crença religiosa. Um filme que tem vários embates de guerra, onde vencem e perdem e vencem até o final que vai para o confroto. "
12 Strong,5,Amazing movie. Highly recommending to everyone.
Candyman,0.5,It was hard to watch the movie with race-baiting as the main theme.
Candyman,3.5,"It was good, I don't think as ""scary"" as the first film. I saw the twist coming over a mile away."
Candyman,3,"A nice update of the horror film, with a very topical take on it. Also loved the Chicago setting."
Candyman,3,"Candyman's story was intriguing and with spectacular visuals it is a decent watch, but for a horror film there was a significant lack of... horror. At no point in the film was there tension, dread, or a sense that I was being lead to a thrilling climax, it was more of a character study on Candyman. The character study aspect was great, I loved hearing the mythos of Candyman from different people in the community. The investigation into the backstory of Candyman paired with commentary on police brutality was really well done, but this was marketed as a horror film and it did not deliver. The cinematography was excellent, there were some really great shots utilizing mirrors and different angles but is that enough? In the end, this movie left me wanting much more."
Candyman,0.5,The movie was down right racist.  It was obviously  produced and directed by cop haters with false doctrine on police violence and racism.
Candyman,2.5,"Barely better than the original, I thought the film did a decent job at showing the racial prejudices that still exist today. They changed Candyman's origin, which is OK, but the ending was awful, just like the original's."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,5,Great character study.
The Talented Mr. Ripley,5,"How's the peeping, Tommy? How's the peeping? Tommy Tommy tommy /Tommy Tommy"
The Talented Mr. Ripley,2,"I think I disliked this for the same reason I don't like ""The Great Gatsby"" - arrogant, unlikeable characters who create their own problems. I realize that's part of the point, but featuring this in a ""thriller"" devoid of suspense or mystery makes for a disappointing result."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,4.5,...LOVED...Approx... My 20th Time Viewing...
The Talented Mr. Ripley,5,"The ratings in general here show how hollow is this pretentious system, as well as how debased is our audience of poorly educated, brain-putirfied people. This movie has so much more talent, style, and quality than 90% of the shows up for review and yet gets mild scores. Sad there is not a more intelligent scrutinizer available."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,3.5,Hating Matt Damon can be so difficult.
The Talented Mr. Ripley,4,"Yes The Talented Mr Ripley is slow at times, but to me it is always absorbing and very rarely boring. The scenery is simply dazzling and really quite exotic, and the costumes and cinematography are gorgeous too. The music is superb, as is Anthony Minghella's direction. The story is very compelling with a number of interesting and well-handled scenes, while the script is both intelligent and thoughtful. The acting is excellent, Matt Damon does wonderfully in a difficult and perhaps controversial role, and Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are equally terrific. Overall, quite an excellent film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
The Talented Mr. Ripley,3,"(Feb-March 2020ish): ""If I'm late, think of what her husband is saying."" The first 50 minutes of this film was so great. Like 4.5/5. But it lost steam toward the end."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,4,"Anthony Minghella's lush and beautifully acted adaptation is particularly well served by Matt Damon's opaque and empty central performance, the parasitic Tom Ripley. John Seale frames the Italian locations with a lushness that contrasts brilliantly with the evil actions taking place within them, Gabriel Yared supplies another supple and subtle score, and among the many excellent supporting performances mention must be made of Philip Seymour Hoffman's odious and creepy Freddie Miles, the moth who flutters too close to the flame. Sad indeed that Minghella and Seymour Hoffman died so young."
The Talented Mr. Ripley,5,Matt Damon's finest performance in my opinion. This movie is just spectacular.  Whenever I see it I just have to watch.
Old,2.5,"While watching this movie on a flight, I kept thinking, this is stupid, the acting is horrible, the scene stitching is horrible. I thought this would be one of those edge of your seats movies, it was far from that. There were a couple of instances where hope was held out, but a big disappointment."
Old,3.5,In the mouth it was lovely
Old,3,"Cool original idea....some crappy acting for sure (Ken Leung seemed to not even be trying at times)...maybe M Night cast poor actors so his own acting would blend in better? Still, neat idea and worth seeing."
Old,1.5,Thoroughly unpleasant movie to sit through. Payoff is interesting but not worth the watch.
Old,1,"I may not have aged an entire lifetime while watching this, but it certainly felt like it. The characters aren't likeable, the dialog isn't engaging, and it drags on forever."
Old,3.5,"M. Night Shyamalan (Drehbuch und Regie), hatte wieder einen Einfall wie wäre es mal mit Älter werden in Zeitraffer. Ein origineller Film, mit einem überraschenden Ende."
Old,2,Excellent premise executed rather poorly.  Vacillates between genuinely creepy and eerie and profoundly silly.
Old,0.5,"Despite my review, I recommend this movie.  Not because it's good.  The characters act incredibly stupid and the movie betray's it's own rules.  When the children age like seven years, the adult's don't look a day older.  I've heard this was based off a much better french comic book.  M.Night Shyamalan is the only character that acts like he has severe head trauma and that might be intentional on his part.  It was fun to make fun of this movie."
Old,1.5,"This was just plain bad. You know there is a twist at the end, because it's M. Night Shyamalan. And the twist was interesting enough, which is why I'm giving this 1.5 stars rather than 0.5 or 1. Unfortunately though, the twist doesn't really change anything that happened throughout the movie up until that point. Unlike, for example, The Sixth Sense, where you have an entirely different perspective about the actions of the people around Bruce Willis after you know he's been dead the whole time, in this movie, everything that happened that seemed ridiculous when you first saw it is still just as ridiculous when you know the twist."
Old,2,"I hate it when the trailer is 100 times better than the actual movie. This movie was a total let down. Great concept, but that's were it ends. Delivery and plot was just lacking. Poor marks from me."
Interstellar,5,"Interstellar is one of the best, beautifully written mind-bending sci-fi movies. That will always be one of my favorites. Although it is a fictional movie, it gives you such a strong heart-twisting authenticity that makes you cry."
Interstellar,4,"Though its grandiose scope sometimes affects my perception on the story and the characters, Interstellar is still a truly fascinating and engrossing film that mostly deserves its almost 3 hour long runtime with an amazing Matthew McConaughey performance, a smart and thought-provoking story as well as layers of emotional depth that permeates through Nolan's glorious direction and the stunning visuals."
Interstellar,5,"One of the greatest films I have ever seen. Tells a very scientific yet heartfelt story, with powerful acting. Also has one of the best film soundtracks ever, and I still listen to it on repeat. While story can be confusing at times, the movie really makes you think deeply about the universe and family. Can watch this movie again and again."
Interstellar,5,"I must say, Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time. The distortion of time, the feelings, the thrilling, the photography and even the very well explored possibility of going to space and visiting the past makes this movie an absolute triumph. "
Interstellar,5,You have to see this movie!
Interstellar,1,"The movie is technecally great. But all this is wasted on gender sterotypes, e.g. anoying little girls grow up to be anoying women saving the day, leading to a crowdpleasing ending. Really? Surviving being ejected out of a spacecraft in a black hole and getting saved minutes before the oxygen runs out....this is pathetic.  Mainstream at its worst."
Interstellar,5,This is my all time favorite movie. It's incredible the amount of work that went into it from the science side - Kip Thorne even wrote a book about it (The Science of Interstellar). Matthew McConaughey is incredible in this. I don't care what people say about it's confusing or doesn't make sense - best movie ever.
Interstellar,4,"High marks for the special effects. The science in it was highly flawed and some of the concepts were laughable. I mean, if they had this level of technology they could have easily just saved the earth. It's laughable how absurd the plot tried to make us think that going to outer space, wormholes, black holes and all the like, were an easier fix than saving the earth."
Interstellar,5,"Awesome! Wonderfully crafted ideas of exploration into the mystery of our cosmos. Truly genius writing, enough that the Webb telescope images that have been recently released show that black holes can look almost exactly to Gargantua that was depicted in interstellar. Ahead of it's time, brilliant and deeply emotional."
Interstellar,4.5,It will be considered as One of the great Sci-Fi Movies of 21st Century.
The Harder They Fall,4.5,"Super stylish movie that was entertaining throughout. The amazing soundtrack stood out to me, and definitely elevated most scenes. Surprisingly emotional as well. Definitely worth a watch if you are into Western films."
The Harder They Fall,3,"What a cast! Their scripts and characters were uneven though. Managed to be slow at times. Very Tarantino wannabe with too much dialogue, stories about characters that were not important. I hated some of the deaths, but then again death shouldn't be satisfying like older simpler westerns would have us believe."
The Harder They Fall,1,Gold grills and a poorly written dialogue ruined what otherwise would have been a decent movie.
The Harder They Fall,4,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
The Harder They Fall,0.5,"Sadly it is just a racist movie. Not because all the main cast is African American, I actually welcome that, and I hope there are way more main roles for minorities in Hollywood. My problem is that, actually, there are several Caucasian characters in the movie but they are all portraited as inept and cowards. All of them, no exceptions. It is not very different than those old movie where the Blacks where stereotyped as simpletons. It was disgusting and divisive then and it is disgusting and divisive now. So fine, make your little racist movie if you want, but let's not pretend it isn't. Shame to the actors that participated in such a despicable film."
The Harder They Fall,3.5,"It's hard to make a fresh western - but this one is just that. A revenge tale in  the segregated old west where brothers are not only criminal, but after each other's throats. And the action is killer."
Blade Runner 2049,3.5,"Another lost flixster rating.  It's too bad, because I wish I would have been able to reread how I felt about the movie.  "
No Time to Die,2,Lots of promise but not a strong effort. What a waste of one of the greatest characters ever created.
No Time to Die,3.5,"It was a longer-than-usual Bond movie, but it was engrossing enough for the time to pass by fast."
No Time to Die,3.5,"Despite not being a huge fan of Daniel Craig's Bond, this was a strong installment in the franchise."
No Time to Die,4,A fantastic conclusion to my favorite James Bond - Daneil Craig. The emotional highs and lows hadn't been this good since Casino Royale! A great sendoff indeed!
No Time to Die,5,SPOILER ALERT
No Time to Die,4,My rating for the film is a 8.1/10
No Time to Die,5,"The aesthetic and cinematography are on point in this movie. In every scene, my thought was, ""I would go there"". A very clever plot, a cool villain, and fun stunts give Daniel Craig a perfect send-off of his James Bond character."
No Time to Die,2.5,"Good special effects, but weak plot."
No Time to Die,3,Bummer ending to Daniel Craig's era.
No Time to Die,3,"Craig has been Bond for so long now it was probably time for him to go regardless of the ending.  Look, this movie is slick and polished, probably more so than most of its predecessors.  Supporting cast was fine, and worries that they would take a crap all over James Bond were mostly unfounded.  There are the gadgets, the parties, etc, and clearly a lot of effort was put in to this.  But in many ways this did not seem like a Bond film.  Craig has never been the dashing party hound like Moore, and he delivers his quips like someone is holding a gun to his head.  He just didn't seem that in to being in this movie either.  Some of the gadgets come off like a checklist (yup, car with machine guns and bomb spikes, check).  (SPOILERS) They give Bond a love interest and a kid, make him all weepy, and then give him a big sendoff whiney death.  And to ram all that in here, they have to make this thing 3 hours long.  I also didn't see Spectre, so I was lost at the beginning, and I assume Waltz was important for some reason, as well as missing an eye for some reason, but no clue.  Malek was an ok villain, but only ok.  I think they assumed because he has a weird screen presence, that would automatically mean menacing, and it didn't.  Also, other than some family revenge thing, no idea why he went to all that effort."
The Gentlemen,4,"Not much depth to it, but a solid action movie if that's what you're looking for."
The Gentlemen,4,Well made movie with perfect casting. The story is strong and not as predictable as most. The over the top storytelling is the only flaw. Trying to hard to be like Tarantino.
The Gentlemen,3.5,"A nicely woven tale that, perhaps, has one too many twists for its own good.  The casting was superb, as each actor seems to have been fitted into the perfect square hole.  The dialog maintains its entertainment value through wit, snarkiness and charm, without going overboard into comedy.  There are some pacing problems where a more robust editing job could have improved the overall enjoyment factor."
The Gentlemen,4.5,"You get what Guy Ritchie always does, a good British Gangster Movie."
The Gentlemen,4.5,Guy Ritchie is one of my favorite directors. I think is his best movie. An absolute must to see.
The Gentlemen,5,Just about as good as it gets from Ritchie
The Gentlemen,4,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
The Gentlemen,4.5,Really a satisfaying movie to see.
The Gentlemen,4,"Alright, alright, alright!!!!"
The Gentlemen,4,"Though it may not hit the high lines of Guy Ritchie, the gentlemen won't disappoint its viewers - Thrived in a jumpy plot it stands tall as a solid movie"
The Card Counter,5,Fantastic movie with an exceptional score/soundtrack. Oscar Isaac is brilliant.
The Card Counter,0.5,"A long confused movie where I kept having to ask what the point of it all was, nothing that happened in the movie mattered, there was 0 character development or even captivating motives for the characters to do anything so frustrated that I spent time to watch this."
The Card Counter,1,"I was engaged at first, the cinematography and conflicted character of William Tell gives a different vibe to the genre of gambling movies. The way this thing keeps leading you along makes you feel as if you are getting to a climax where in the end it just falls flat. At the end of the day I feel like I will never get that time back that I wasted watching this...I kept waiting for it to arrive, then it just falls apart at the end. And not in a clever way, not in a way that is a good piece of writing. It just leaves you feeling like you wasted your time..."
Captain Marvel,5,"This movie is very special to me, not only because of the participation of Brie and Samuel, but the stories of Captain Marvel are amazing and the movie itself is very captivating!"
Captain Marvel,4.5,"Really enjoyable origin story with lots of unique characters, lore and super impressive CGI. "
Captain Marvel,4,"Although being review-bombed by misogynist bigots, Captain Marvel still isn't all THAT good. Brie Larson may have needed more time to figure things out, and some cringey writing definitely needed to be revised. It maintains its four stars due to a compelling plot and a fantastic performance from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury--but we already knew that."
Captain Marvel,2.5,Captain Marvel just needs more in-depth character. Watching her in the story is just uninspiring. Because the story is boring and unengaging. The only good thing about this movie is young nick's furry and the plot twist of the Skrull.
Captain Marvel,5,"Injustiçado! Delícia de filme! Leve, despretensioso e emocionante."
Captain Marvel,5,This movie is the long kiss goodnight with geena Davis but in space
Captain Marvel,3,"Best thing about this movie was the special effects. I wanted to give it lower marks because I personally just don't like the main lead, but I have to be fail and balanced. And this movie was actually not as bad as most people make it out to be. I get that we all don't like the main actress but we can't destroy the film over it. It was a mediocre film and the effects were good. It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't good. Plot wasn't great, acting was mediocre."
Captain Marvel,0.5,Captain Marvel was just awful. The leads acting was as dry as a over cooked piece of toast and as entertaining as watching paint dry.  The writing was not great. This character seems so forced down our throats and so OP to further force it that it was hard to be interested. Maybe focusing on better writing will make this character and future movies more like able. This was awful.
Tenet,2.5,"Visually and technically, this movie is really cool. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are a fun duo and they work well together onscreen. The opening scene was gripping."
Tenet,3,"Visually excellent and has some interesting ideas around time travel, but fundamentally fails to deliver the basics in terms of story telling. Watching Tenet is definitely an experience but I would say *not* an enjoyable one. Nolan's baffling decision to make the dialogue nearly inaudible in places means much of what happens on screen is with little or no context. This is a film that really needs multiple viewings to understand what is going on, but doesn't actually make you want to subject yourself to what is essentially a painful to watch big budget film-making experiment more than once."
Tenet,3,"Just another confused time jumbled hyper steroidal overwrought action movie. Puzzling plot, overworked characters always on the verge of destruction. Washington is well cast and well played but his bright performance struggles to make this muddle work Please Hollywood. Enough."
Tenet,0.5,"I felt that this movie dragged on too long. The idea was good but it felt like it was trying to be clever instead of good. I think I would mainly avoid Christopher Nolan's movies anyway, there only good if there's a storyline already there to focus on like Batman or Dunkirk."
Tenet,4,"It demands Multiple-time to watch., One of the best Sci-Fi Movies (In 10 years) after ""Interstellar""."
Tenet,5,John David Washington was the reason I saw this movie. Didn't dissapont at all
Tenet,3.5,"This movie is good, for people who like to do homework to understand the plot."
Tenet,2,I'd recommend watching this film with a pen and paper in hand and Sheldon Cooper working out the science on his whiteboard. Maybe then I could  judge if this film was even worth the two and a half hours. Unfortunately I'm not about to watch it a second time to find out!
Tenet,2,"Fast, shallow, dialogue used to skim over a terribly absurd concept, implemented with banality and pretentiousness."
Tenet,4,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
Red Notice,0.5,DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!!
Red Notice,2.5,Over the top slapstick.  Storyline is totally unrealistic. Makes Indiana Jones seem like a history dissertation.
Red Notice,1,Orribile.
Red Notice,1,Painfully Brain Numbing
Red Notice,4,"Lots of plot twists, I have been shocked when I watched, what a experienced!"
Red Notice,0.5,"Bons atores, roteiro horrível.."
Red Notice,1,"Red Notice was not funny or entertaining. It had a stupid plot that involved an art thief (Ryan Reynolds) and an FBI agent (Dwayne Johnson), Reynolds was trying to get the legendary 3 eggs of Cleopatra while Johnson was trying to clear his name. Reynolds was cracking bad jokes the whole time, while Johnson was trying to clear his name by capturing ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot). But for some reason, the only way to clear his name was by assisting Reynolds in stealing the eggs. So far it's already a crappy movie with boring action sequences that look fake. The characters also make no sense, FYI. Reynolds became a thief because he wanted his Dad's attention and love. But his dad is a cop so I can't really see why him stealing things will make his dad love him. And Reynolds's whole villain backstory is because his dad accused him of stealing a watch that he loved and didn't talk to him for a year. Then we go to Johnson and Gadot who have been secretly in love this whole time and working with each other. And mind you the only reason these characters want the eggs isn't for some mystic powers or secrets to the universe, no it's because some billionaire will pay them a crap load of cash. So, the two lovebirds turn on Reynolds and take the egg. They leave him in handcuffs where the cops were right on their tail, but somehow Reynolds escapes, finds Johnson and Gadot, and all is forgiven and he's got a new business opportunity for them leaving it on a cliffhanger and room for a sequel. I'd be shocked if anyone wanted a sequel to this awful film. This just shows that it doesn't matter if you have an all-star cast and a big budget, if you still have crappy writers and a dumb plot the movie is going to suck."
Red Notice,0.5,"ah yes another movie where the rock plays the rock who is not a good actor and Gal Gadot who acts worse than the rock, saving grace was Ryan Reynolds"
Red Notice,2,"Red Notice is a run of the mill spy adventure with twists, turns, and an inflated runtime that leaves the movie feeling bloated. I was having a decent time in the start of the movie, I enjoyed the back and forth between Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds, the set pieces were great, and the plot was somewhat interesting. But after awhile, the movie got stale as the same style jokes were recycled and the plot kept being strung along. All the acting was fine in the film, but by this point Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds. There is no diversity in their acting, every role they take on is the exact same. In the beginning it was fine, but too much of a good thing is not enough. I found myself getting increasingly bored throughout the duration of the film, and the ending was a grind to get through. The twists at the end were interesting, although if I was remotely engaged in the plot I could have spotted it from a mile away. Overall, this film was below average cinema, even after the spending $60m plus on star power."
Red Notice,4,CGI was noticeably bad in the bull scene as well as when Ryan jumped from car to car in the Nazi tunnel. But Ryan makes any movie funny. Ed was surprising and funny as well. Very good and unexpected betrayal. Overall a solid movie.
Nobody,5,"Masterpice, I love it from the start to the end. Perfect story, music, efects and background. The Best action movie of the decade sincerly."
Nobody,1.5,"Dunno why this movie gets high ratings. It's just a movie about a guy who kills people because he likes killing people and the movie indulges itself in it, pretending that's a cool concept. It turned into downright comical shlock at the end. Problem is, action scenes are just visual blur when there's nothing to care about. Didn't care about him, his family or anyone else. Turned it off. Dumb script and wasted time. If I wanted to see John Wick again, I'd just watch John Wick again."
Nobody,3.5,"The action is electric, thoroughly making up for any flaws in storytelling."
Nobody,5,"Very good film, wish I'd seen it earlier"
Nobody,5,"I honestly do not care what anyone else has to say about this movie, I loved it! From the beginning of his going no were life to exploding into the crazy, kick ass hardcore, fighter and methodical killing machine blew me away! He did it so quietly and purposely without us knowing who, how or what he was? If Bob Odenkirk wasn't the lead character, sure it could have been just another Die Hard movie.  But because it was Bob Odenkirk HE MADE THIS MOVIE GREAT!!  I'm female and Bob is not some heart throb actor. Bob O. has his very own unique style, expressions, one of a kind dead pan humor and timing that I makes him lovable and a great actor. He's the Steve McQueen, Robert Redford, Paul Newman of the 21st century. Lucky us! Yeah there's a lot of blood shots and violence but the choreography, cinematography and editing was impeccable. With a great sound track!  I agree whole heartedly with the tandeki review (April 2021). Ilya Naishuller made his mark on cinema with Nobody and put him up there with the big boys. I hope to see more of Ilya's work. And Bob Odenkirk is one of the greatest unsung hero's in film/series."
Nobody,4.5,really good. John Wick style movie.
Nobody,5,"Loved this a must see for a hardcore action lover and also John wick , Rambo , James Bond fans will love it like me."
Irresistible,2.5,"Temática interessante, roteiro fraco e forçado. Atuações medianas."
Irresistible,5,"This film has been poorly understood, and yet needs to be understood very well. Watch it right through until the very end. Some segments are shown during the credits."
Irresistible,1.5,"Struggling To Define The Pathway Of The Story, At Times The Abrupt Comedy Style Threw Me Right Off. Overall The Final Twist Of Story Adds Weight & Food For Thought, But It Wasn't Enough To Make It Anything Noteworthy."
Irresistible,4,"Funny . I have watched a few politic comedy movies or tv shows , this movie is so fun ."
Irresistible,1,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I like politics, but the premise of this movie makes no sense. This film wastes the talent of its cast who I really like. It's pretentious and patronizing to demonize the entire political system. This movie would be better off being a documentary on Frontline. There is no entertainment value whatsoever in this film and I don't understand why Steve Carrel, who is so funny, would get involved in this project. Do not waste your time watching this."
Irresistible,3,This turned out better than I thought it might.  There's a significant twist near the end that makes it interesting.  It's a bit on-the-nose about the state of dysfunction of all that is politics and politics-adjacent.
Irresistible,4.5,Great movie that satires all things politics.  Hilarious movie that is well written and acted.  I would recommend for anyone that has any interest in politics and anyone that can stomach a movie about politics.  It is worth it!
Irresistible,3.5,"Commedia ironica, graffiante e clamorosamente volgare."
Irresistible,4.5,"Excellent balance, and eye opening. The American political system needs an overhaul."
Irresistible,2,"The only thing that ended up making this worthwhile was the twist and surprise ending.  Other than that, the story tried too hard to be big league and did not succeed."
Logan,5,"Everything you could want in a dark, gritty, and violent super hero film. The writing for this film is fantastic and the acting is even better. Hugh Jackman leads this film perfectly but all of his co cast members do an excellent job to make this film feel as real as possible. The gore in this film is crazy but not distracting or over the top. The twists and turns of this story are executed to near perfection and the emotion of this story is strong."
Logan,5,Amazing. One of the few truly great marvel movies.
Logan,5,James Mangold's gritty take on the superhero Wolverine is an interesting and welcome take on the old man with claws and a big heart. A film that nostalgically reminds you of the original X-Men while propelling forward in this unique story that Hugh Jackman skillfully displays with every emotion. An unforgettable movie that pulls you in with every scene.
Logan,4.5,Really good. We need more R rated marvel movies.
Logan,4,"As a superhero drama in which main part takes not the action scenes but emotional feelings of characters, that is a small change in Marvel universe."
Logan,5,What a way to end an impactful characters legacy. It has some surprises that I didn't expect which led to an even more entertaining story. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat during the whole thing. Was also filled with so many emotions where I just didn't want the movie to end. This was definitely Hugh Jackman at his peak.
Thor,3.5,"It's better than The Incredible Hulk, but that doesn't make it great. It's just a little too boring. It doesn't hold up for a rewatch, and it's a chore to get through the first time, too. The movie is saved by stellar performances from Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Kat Dennings."
Thor,2.5,This movie at times is very boring and fails to keep the viewers interest. At times the movie feels very lifeless and dull however it does pass the time and is an alright introduction to Thor.
Thor,4.5,"Such an under rated MCU film. A great origin story that introduces one of the classic Avengers and villains beautifully, in a very Shakespearean style. Good drama and absolutely beautiful soundtrack from Patrick Doyle. I revisited this movie after sitting through the catastrophic Thor 4, and was so relieved and happy to see this movie take Thor seriously: his character and story are not the constant butt of jokes. I still think this is the best Thor movie. Love and Thunder was terrible, and Ragnarok, while cool at the time,has lost some of its luster as the jokes and belittling of Thor have grown old. Thor 1 still feels fresh, 11 years later. It's more of a thoughtful film than an action film, and I love it for that. It prioritizes a good story over explosions and colors. It's substance over spectacle."
Thor,1,Pathetic and stupid..Thor should be wearing a clown suit. This movie is comical and 10yr olds would probably love it.
Thor,4,This is one of those films that is actually better on a repeat viewing. The use of Dutch angles is atrocious but the story is well written. A good foundation for turning one of the most consistently boring Marvel heroes into someone interesting enough to warrant a film fanbase.
Thor,3.5,One of the less good marvel movies but still good.
Thor,3.5,"The 4th MCU film, Kenneth Branagh gives us a compelling enough story, talented cast and a stunning world environment. Asgard is stunning, it's the first time we see it on the big screen and it doesn't disappoint, especially for 2011. This film gives us the beginning of Thor's tragic character arc, is this film he's a arrogant, almost childish character. The first film is the most serious of the 4 and I appreciate that, I love what Thor becomes but the first film tried something and although it didn't pay off as much as the later films it is still entertaining and worth a watch."
Thor,5,"After i see Thor 4 ,THIS first movie is the best Thor movie ,reflects the real character (i mean ,COMICS) ... maybe Thor 2 have some flaws ,but 3 and 4 is garbage."
Thor,2.5,well I was expecting a lot more it was okay but I wont be paying to see this one a second time in the theater. it was a little boring and the comedy in it was dumb. and the climax fight was bad. I guess the MCU has decided to take lessons from Kathleen Kennedy
Thor,5,Best Thor to this day ... The origin story is just amazing
EMMA.,1,So sad that the wonderfull Jane Austin's Emma has been filmed in such an over-the-top Willy Wonka style that tries to be painfully amusing. There are so many adaptations of Emma but this scrapes the very bottom by some margin.
EMMA.,2,This ‘modern' adaptation awkwardly plays out more like a childish pantomime parody of Emma with over the top characters that bring a grimace rather than a smile. While there is lavash colours and strong cinematography somehow the poor choice of  ‘Carry On' style dialogue and accompanying music manages to only deliver a show that amounts to nothing more than farcical nonsense.
EMMA.,4,"Emma is the greatest novel in the English language.  This film does a fantastic job adapting it, and communicating its buoyancy and spirit."
EMMA.,0.5,I didn't like the movie. The characters seemed like cartoons. It didn't have any of the class that is usually associated with Jane Austen novels. I don't think I could have followed the plot very well if I weren't so family with the book and other film of the book. This film was really weak in my opinion.
EMMA.,1.5,The people who made this didn't understand why we love the old movies.
EMMA.,3,"A mixed bag of an adaptation. Anya Taylor-Joy is really good in the lead role; but it's hard to get a handle on the other performances because - especially in the first 45 minutes or so - the direction, cinematography, and editing are all too sharp and quick to really get to grips with the characters. It's as if those involved drank too much energy drink before coming to work each day. The same extends to the comedy; sometimes it's effective, much of the time you half-expect a ‘laugh now' signboard to appear onscreen. It's better when it settles down a little later in the film; it's no coincidence that the film's a high point, a delightfully awkward picnic scene, not sparingly uses the techniques that litter much of the rest of the film. It's funny and moving together, a combination that the film itself reaches for throughout but only occasionally reaches."
EMMA.,5,"I thought the film was absolutely delightful. Emma was perfect as Emma, as was Mr Knightly. In fact, all the characters were very well cast: Harriet, in particular.  The film was lovely to look at, too. Thanks for a most enjoyable experience."
EMMA.,5,I Saw the 1996 versión but this is quite more adorable since the actors and their performance is more real. The Best Me Knightley!
EMMA.,0.5,"Emma has a very annoying accent.  Very snooty, unlikeable and condescending.  This is the first thing I noticed when watching.  It's like a spoil wealthy girl, who thinks she knows it all but is quite clueless.  You just wish very bad things happen to her so she gets a grip on reality the hard way.  A lot of suffering would do her character a world of good or at least make me feel good, the latter being more important.  For the first 30 minutes, it just drags on and on...not even sure what this movie is about.  It's like watching the daily lives of the privileged old English society teens/young adults without the drama, bad behavior or anything exciting going on...just a lot of talking about nothing. The second thing I really noticed is that Anya Taylor Joy's haircut...is very unbecoming...it doesn't suit her face at all...makes her look really weird and unpleasant, combined with her accent and the way she talks is a one two knockout combination, you just want to sleep through this movie.  Seriously her face is very oval and her haircut looks like a tight form fitting skull cap with a flap on the top back end.  It's only after the first 30 minutes something actually happens.  She convinces someone not to marry above her station and then it goes back to the boring talking about nothing again.  I can't believe someone thought this would be a good movie.  A movie about nothing interesting, let's spend millions making it...we can claim the losses as a tax deduction.   Is this what this movie is about...?!  I am beginning to think so...there is a lot of business owners that run a variety of stores and businesses, but have 1 of those business lose a lot of money to claim the losses on their taxes for a substantial tax credit.  I think this is what's going on with this movie...otherwise the studio exe was really drunk or high when he green lit this multimillion dollar movie that people are surely to have walked out of the theatre mid way.  I am half way through and I still don't understand the point of this movie.  Is there a point, oh right to lose money for a substantial tax credit.  I forgot...like this movie I hope, oh wait then that would mean I may watch it again and I really don't want to put myself through this ever again."
EMMA.,2.5,"I will watch every Jane Austen adaptation, but I found this one too over the top and too tongue in cheek. The costumes are fabulous though."
Hereditary,5,"This is one of those movies that you just have to see for yourself.  If you like psychological thrillers, horror, and are looking to satiate your thirst for a spooky movie this is the one."
Hereditary,5,"My favorite breed of horror, the scare is there the whole time...slowly coming in to view as you realize it's been there the whole time. A masterpiece of suspense and anxiety that makes me scared to watch again. Lurking in the shadows even though I know its coming, lingering fear is potent."
Hereditary,5,The best horror film ever made! Collette deserved an oscar for her performance!
Hereditary,2,An overrated one.
Hereditary,2,"It built very slowly after the first major event and relied on pretty cheesy horror tropes from there on out. Then kind of culminated in a trippy 'Rosemary's Baby'-esque ending, but it was all developed pretty poorly and was somewhat disappointing for how strong it began."
Hereditary,0.5,A waste of two hours.  Not even worth a half of a star.  Top 10 worst movies I have had on my TV.
Hereditary,5,A blend of supernatural horror and tragedy that is very disturbing.
Hereditary,5,Pretty good. Ending could have been much better.
Hereditary,4.5,"Beautifully shot with some incredible performances, this film really unnerved me to the extent that I slept with the lights on for two nights. It's made even more terrifying by the eerie film score by Colin Stetson. "
Hereditary,1.5,"The only redeeming quality of this movie is Toni Collette's performance. In my opinion, this movie is trying so hard to be something that it isn't. Not really sure why there's hype around it."
Paddington 2,5,Possibly the best movie of all time.
Paddington 2,5,"Perfect in every way. Hugh Grant has never been better and if you don't cry at the ending, you have no soul! A masterpiece"
Paddington 2,5,"It's so emotional, love the movie. The plot is amazing 10/10"
Paddington 2,5,GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Paddington 2,4.5,"Heartwarming movie, will make you cry for sure"
Paddington 2,4,Paddington Brown is a gift to the universe who must be protected at all costs.
Paddington 2,5,"LOL, the funniest 01 hour: and 43 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Paddington 2,4,"This is just a great children's/family movie. It encourages seeing the best in all people, optimism, care for others, and keeping your community close. The ending is genuinely moving and the ride there is very fun. As is the case with the first Paddington, it is tough to emphasize enough how perfect Sally Hawkins is as Paddington's adoptive mother. Hugh Grant also makes for a fantastic whimsical villain."
Paddington 2,5,Amazing movie. Worth a watch loved. Paddington was the best
Paddington 2,5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
Terminator: Dark Fate,2,"I was encouraged by better-than-expected reviews, but this is utterly forgettable.   Scene after scene of a shapeshifting killer robot that runs, jumps, stabs, slashes, wrecks, and is shot to pieces; it then reassembles, reamalgamates, and remorphs.  Rinse, repeat; and repeat; and repeat.  The difference from Terminator 2 is that the robot internals are black instead of silvery.  And, oh, it can do a double act with an autonomous  skeleton that squidges in and out of its body.  There's no room for any acting since all characters are either robots, or robotically obsessed with a single-track objective."
Terminator: Dark Fate,0.5,"What in heavens name is this ?  Arnie and Hamilton look like worn furniture ? Gutted that MacKenzie is in this, I expected better in her career path. It's a bit like the Stones, touring again ……… One to avoid I'm afraid."
Terminator: Dark Fate,1,"Well, the Terminator franchise really has jumped the shark with this one. How the mighty giant has fallen. Somehow I had the sneaky suspicion this was going to be a dud, and boy was I right. I've not even seen the end of it yet but I guess the evil T ends up being destroyed in a factory of dry ice or liquid steel. I believe this bombed at the box office - what were they thinking."
Terminator: Dark Fate,5,Ages 17 and older!!!!!!!! Featuring 02 hours: and 08 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Terminator: Dark Fate,5,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 BEST TERMINATOR I EVER SEEN
Terminator: Dark Fate,0.5,This film was full of so many eye rolls... one after another. My eyes were literally sore from it by the end of this horribly made film. I do NOT recommend this ridiculous movie to anyone. It was so bad
Terminator: Dark Fate,1,"Generic , boring, silly. These women survive everything without a scratch. And in the meantime they destroy a superterminator. The only person who has a bit of fun with her character is Linda Hamilton."
Terminator: Dark Fate,2.5,"This movie brought nothing new to the franchise which first two brought. It was just a simple continuation with the same story as first two. It looked like the writer didn't work hard to get a good story. The performances by cast were also normal. The direction was little bit loose, the director was not able to create tensed environment. Overall, it was a normal continuation of the franchise."
Terminator: Dark Fate,3,"Let's be honest, this franchise probably ran out of steam after Terminator 2. That will still remain my favourite Terminator movie of the entire series. This one wasn't necessarily a horrible movie but it wasn't amazing either. "
The Matrix Resurrections,4,The Matrix is back!!
The Matrix Resurrections,2,"I bailed after the first hour. It felt like a low-budget knock-off of the prior versions. Everybody involved is kind of dialing it in, and thank you check please. It such a pale shadow of former editions they keep showing clips from the first Matrix. It doesn't help. It only reminds you how flaccid and boring #4 is compared to #1."
The Matrix Resurrections,0.5,É triste ver o que fizeram com uma obra que influenciou tantas pessoas em todo o mundo.
Midsommar,5,"This is pretty incredible, Pugh rocks"
Midsommar,5,"Remarkable! A unique vision of grief, toxic relationships, and family. I rate this a tie with The Invitation as best film about a cult."
Midsommar,0.5,Please please please save yourself time and skip this terrible movie
Midsommar,5,"I loved this movie! It's one of the best thriller movies I've ever seen, with a very well written story full of details. The lead actress Florence Pugh is fabulous and so are the other actors. It's an excellent movie!"
Midsommar,5,"Midsommar was the first movie I have ever seen that I felt truly depicted the experience of grieving. It gives an absolutely amazing portrayal of raw emotion, and sparks very interesting commentary about empathy, morality, and community. It is also deeply unsettling in a way that stays with you for a long time. I've watched it at least four times, and will most likely watch it more than that."
Midsommar,0.5,Absolutely terrible.  Movie was boring and the acting sucked big time.
Midsommar,5,"The only reason the audience reviews aren't great is because the movie is hard to understand for the average person. If you appreciate the art of filmmaking, you'll definitely love this movie! This is one of my favorites!"
Midsommar,2,"The cinematography was nothing to get close to. This film is an actual work of art in how they managed to choose their main concepts of filming, But the story wasn't cool, I felt that the film was empty, It has nothing to do with anything else except being colorfully and full of amazing/mind-blowing shots. "
Midsommar,4.5,"Florence Pugh knocked it out of the park, same as every performance she gives. She carried the film."
Midsommar,1.5,It has an original script but is too slow and predictable.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0.5,This movie is so bad that I'm getting sad and tired as I type this single line review.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0.5,"Yes, sucks bad. Bad, bad."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,3.5,"not that good of a movie, but an amazing save from the last movie which was a disaster..."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,3,My rating for the film is a 6.8/10
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2,"I only gave this a 2 star rather than half a star because The Last Jedi (TLJ) made it impossible for anyone to get this movie right. The plot of the movie just doesn't make sense. ""Somehow Palpatine returned"", yeah somehow... So getting thrown down an engine shaft straight into the core of the death star is a survivable experience - This is not an ability that has ever been discussed, but they pass it off by saying ""The Dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" stealing the line out of RoTS but out of context. All this means is that Darth Vader died for nothing, this is a MAJOR PLOT HOLE - the prophecy of the chosen one is that Anakin/Vader would bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith - Before this movie, the prophecy was intact. The Plot is also full of coincidences, Lando just happens to be on the planet to provide assistance just as the gang turn up, without him they would be captured, he just so happens to know the location they need to look for the way finder, they get this dagger by complete luck after falling through some kind of new quicksand that happens to have tunnels underneath, the dagger is inscribed in the language of the Sith, C3PO can translate it but cant tell anyone so this leads them on a stupid side quest to reveal the location of the wayfinder... The whole movie just feels like coincidence after coincidence rather than logical decisions are being made to advance the movie. "
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0.5,Negative stars. The one great character they had in this movie was not the main lead and he was abused by the horrible plot and storytelling.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,1,"I gotta be brutally honest, this movie is not good at all. This movie spends most of its time trying to undo The Last Jedi which is a very cowardly thing to do. As someone who actually liked The Last Jedi, that really annoyed me. Because now I can't watch Force Awakens and Last Jedi without thinking that this is how the trilogy ends. The ending itself is just trash. For a standalone film the ending could work but this is the ending to a nine part saga. And it's a rushed mess that you will probably forget about what happened at points when you finish it. The one word that can describe this movie is Overwhelming and not in a good way. I also hate that Palpatine is in this movie. It completely ruins Anakins sacrifice. But I gotta give credit where it's due, Ian Mcdiarmid was phenomenal as Palpatine. In fact, all the actors were giving it their all. This movie does have good moments but if I'm judging the whole thing, I can't give it a good score. This movie is proof that Disney had no plan whatsoever with this trilogy."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0.5,Terrible end to George Lucas' next level story telling
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,4,great effect good story
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2.5,Why does this film have to be so dumb? They gave up on trying something new and instead brought back a villain who already served his purpose. This movie was the best I could have been coming off the previous film which was not good either.
John Wick,5,"Definitely a new addition to someone's movie foundation. A wonderful story about loss and revenge in a fantastical world of organized assassination, even making that organization elegant with a code of ethics and notoriety. This is as essential a watch as Bourne Identity, Taken, and The Fugitive."
John Wick,3.5,A good action film. Nothing extremely special and over exaggerated fights but still good. I did like Hardcore Henry more though.
John Wick,4,"In spite of a bit tacked-on ending and somewhat rushed nature at times, John Wick is an exciting time fueled by its stylistic appearance, impressive action sequence and a strong Keanu Reeves performance."
John Wick,5,This is so amazing; the story & the action sequences are impressive.
John Wick,5,Just saw the movie it's a pure masterpiece of gangster genre it is a smooth movie just sometimes give godfather level vibes a must watch for a hard core  blood slaughtering action lover.
John Wick,4,"É um bom filme, bem executado, Keanu tem uma grande performance. Só tem uma cena que chamo de artificio de roteiro (não faz sentido, mas os roteiristas colocam para poder prolongar o filme e salvar o personagem) que é a cena em que Wick é pego e em vez de ser morto por um tiro, tentam matar ele sufocado por um saco plástico o que não faz sentido, pois é um filme com armas e facas. Mas mesmo assim não estraga a jornada do personagem. Recomendo."
John Wick,3.5,"A good start, yet not as fun or iconic as the next two"
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,4.5,"An entertaining movie filled with fantastic performances and gripping dialogue. Although, this movie is slightly directionless as I was 2/3rds of the way through the movie and had no idea where it was trying to take me. Despite that fact, I still was engaged and had a great time watching. The third act is so off the walls and crazy that it makes the entire slow burn of the film worth every second."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,2,Long uninteresting unfocussed movie.
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,4,Slow however interesting
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,3,Blobbo not see. Too too long.  
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,1,"I am a huge QT fan.  It's his first truly unwatchable film.  It's so very long and boring.  Ultimately the story is too big to ignore.  The whole ""it never happened"" thing while sweet, feels forced.   Like Bobby's ""it was all a dream"" Dallas cliffhanger resolution, it robs the viewer of the authenticity of the previous hours of tension running through a seasoned and dedicated fan.  An artist experiments.  Occasionally, they are wrong.  It is what it is.  And it is a drag."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,4,"Tarantino' style of storytelling but not the typical action packed thriller but old hollywood nostalgia thriller that has different twist which audiences would appreciate (as we all know what really happened). Great acting as expected from leading ACTORS- yes that is including Margot Robbie as per ""Flower Girl"" character."
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood,5,"Amazing, the performances, the plot, the historical context"
Pig,5,Nicolas Cage is a force of nature
Pig,4.5,Who knew that a film titled 'Pig' would be so beautiful and moving!
Pig,4.5,"On the surface Pig is a basic story of a man on the search for his lost pig, but underneath the initial layer is a deep and compelling character study on love and loss."
Pig,3.5,"I avoided this for a time, largely out of my stubborn ambivalence about Nicolas Cage in a moment when he seemed to me to be getting an outsized amount of praise. I also didn't really know what the film is; where it fits, when to watch it. I'm glad to have finally seen it; it's most movingly about grief, and the attachments we form and break when grieving. It's also fairly clearly about food, and especially our relationship to the raw ingredients that become our meals. Cage is excellent, but the rest of the characters seemed a little too underwritten. It could have been more - it felt like Leave No Trace covered some similar ground much more powerfully for me. But Pig is still affecting and memorable, even if it's more slight than it would like to be."
Pig,4.5,I hate slow dramas but this one is great.
Pig,5,"Near masterpiece. Quiet, subtle, powerful. With this one movie, Nicholas Cage has completely redeemed himself from decades of mediocre movies."
Avengers: Infinity War,4,"It never seemed as surprising or shocking to me as everyone else, but it is certainly a great movie with an uncomfortable narrative, great action, a great villain and it makes our effort worth following all the MCU movies."
Avengers: Infinity War,5,Beautiful build-up to the epic finale of this Infinity saga
Avengers: Infinity War,5,Yeah. It's really THAT good.
Avengers: Infinity War,4,My rating for the film is a 8.7/10
Avengers: Infinity War,5,"Perfeito! Dramaturgia, personagens, ação, humor na medida e um final memorável!"
Ad Astra,2.5,"A solid lead performance from Brad Pitt, stunning cinematography and a touching father-son theme does make Ad Astra on some accounts worth it, but its clear logic defying aspects and some weirdly incorporated scenes combined with a drab and in my opinion poorly handled plot makes the film not stick out in the end."
Ad Astra,2,"Less exciting, less emotional, less interesting and less visually stunning interstellar, with same, exact message to live in the moment, delivered in much more disappointing way. Don't expect some big twist, nor life changing, cathartic experience. Expect Brad Pitt floating in space suit for 2 hours and maby, just maby you won't be disappointed. (You can't even see that hot mf 80% of the time, it's just a space suit.) Wanna see a movie about father-child bond? Well, watch interstellar coz you won't see it here. Monkey was the best part this."
Ad Astra,1.5,Pitt is very brand on this movie maybe the writing calls for such performance this one's a miss
Ad Astra,4,"Brad Pitt is astronaut Roy McBride, tasked with a dangerous mission by SpaceCom to trek across the galaxy and investigate the source of recent strange power surges. The theory is that these oddities are coming from the Lima Project, an expedition undertaken by Roy's Father (Tommy Lee Jones) nearly three decades previously. Roy's superiors are worried that McBride senior may have been the reason all contact was lost with the Lima Project, although this is something they don't share with Roy. Ad Astra is ambitious in scale and spectacle, anchored by an excellent central performance by Pitt, calmly taking in his frequently languorous and lonely work. The opening sequence is reminiscent of the first half an hour of Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity (2013), and despite being stunningly shot; it perhaps doesn't have the same impact as Cuaron's sequence. However, Ad Astra is a better film than Gravity in most respects; despite its slow nature it's frequently tense, and the action set pieces that are scattered throughout are dramatic and dazzling. It's an intelligent science fiction film that was critisised for not being one thing or the other- an all out space thriller or a more nuanced psychological thriller (like Duncan Jones' superb Moon [2009] for example) but I have to disagree with that particular foible. James Gray nails the fusion of these two styles with aplomb, making both the characters and the audience earn their satisfaction, and with it, ensuring that he's helmed one of the best sci-fi films of the last few years."
Ad Astra,0.5,This would have to be the worst movie Brad Pit has ever stared in. Just a terrible waste of time.
Ad Astra,2,"Pointless, irrelevant and nonsensical movie"
Ad Astra,1.5,How I watched this to the end Is a mystery.  To say it's dull is an overstatement.  If you're basing your sci-if on science at least make it plausible.  At least I watched this on network tv and didn't pay money to watch it
Ad Astra,1,"What a terrible, depressing, load of garbage!  Why are so many contemporary science-fiction films so utterly dismal?  Sci-fi can be inspiring and life-affirming - but this was the opposite.  I wish I'd never seen it."
Ad Astra,5,Really interesting and fascinating movie.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0.5,"Last Jedi was my first disappointment in life with a Star Wars content. I left the theater and I was stunned, I couldn't believe the garbage that I had watched. Thanks Rian Johnson and Disney to make me feel so miserable with something that always gave me so much joy."
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0.5,"a huge disaster, should've never switch directors"
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3,My rating for the film is a 6.7/10
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3.5,"I decided to finally review this movie after a lot of time and after watching it a few times. Because I still was trying to figure out why so many people hated this movie. And I'm just going to say that yes it has some definite flaws, but I still think it's way better than The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and The Rise of Skywalker, which I like less and less each time I watch that one."
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0.5,I would give negative ten stars if I could. The kindest thing I can say is that this movie was just terrible. And that's the kindest thing I can say.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0.5,This film was nearly unwatchable trash that only gets points for being pretty but falls apart under any reasonable scrutiny.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3.5,"I was confused about what I should give this film but I gave it the highest my heart would let me a 3.5. This film messes with Luke Skywalker and who he is at his core. This film also messes up Finn's character, they should have let him die giving his character purpose and meaning. This film was not hot trash but is far from good."
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0.5,"The Last Jedi is not only an insult to the very foundations of what makes Star Wars such a beautiful escape from reality, but it is also a downright sloppy movie with blatant plot holes that run throughout the movie's entirety. With appalling writing and plot lines so confusing and pointless they make Admiral Holdo's plan look genius, this abomination is one of the worst examples of ""story"" telling to ever be created."
Joker,1,"It's soooooo dramatic. Don't you feel bad for this poor man who gets abused by society? He's not bad, it's everyone else who is. It's soooooo dramatic!!"
Joker,1.5,"Overhyped, underwhelming. I mainly didnt see this Joker to become the Joker he suppose to become. This one is depressive and sad for 90% of the movie. Im actually sad that i saw it."
Joker,3.5,Phoenix gives another bravura performance! He and Christian Bale are some of the best actors current!
Joker,0.5,"Yes, the movie is artistic but it is basically a look at an insane and sorry super abused individual for 2 hours."
Joker,1,"a very good homage to Martin Scorsese, but a pretty crappy comic book movie. Edgelords rejoice"
Joker,4.5,Really good origin story for Joker.
Joker,5,"This modern masterpiece makes you sympathize with a character and understand what builds up inside the mind of a villain. It had a brilliant soundtrack, and perfect song choices. This is one of those movies I always come back to, whether it's obsessing over it for months, or rewatching it."
Joker,5,"AMAZING, MINDBLOWING THIS FILM WAS JUST A SHEER MASTERPIECE OF HOLLOYWOOD"
Joker,4.5,"Joker is a very interesting and novel take on the Joker character. While I still prefer Ledgers Joker, I did love this movie. It's just one big character study, and a dang good one at that. It's gripping, tragic and exiting, making you sympathize and understand a man that was completely out of the realm of our understanding before. The Joker has always been a sort of unexplainable phenomenon, with no name and backstory seemingly, he was always more mysterious. They give him all that here and it's done really well. Arthur is an interesting and tragic person, Mentally unstable and continuously brought down lower in lower because of increasingly terrible situations he finds himself in until he finally snaps. Now this movie doesn't make you think he's a good guy now, no, the movie just makes you understand joker. Not to mention the visuals are stunning and brilliant, with a lovely new look for the clown prince of crime and a pretty good score. Overall it is a very violent, Bloody and downright disturbing movie at times but if that's something you're okay with, then the Joker is definetely a movie to watch."
Joker,5,"Atuação sensacional, filme muito bom."
Shazam!,4,"Shazam! is a fresh take on the superhero genre, combining humor, action, and drama into an entertaining movie. The casting is great, and Zachary Levi especially does a great job. Where this movie struggles is with the tone; sometiems it feels like a kids movie, and other times it can be very dark. There are also not many connections to the other DCEU movies, making Shazam! feel like a standalone project. The villan, while he starts out having interesting development, turns into generic ""I need power"" baddy halfway through. But the humor, cast, and powerful emotional moments make up for the flaws."
Shazam!,2.5,I love funny but gah dayum this doesn't feel like a dc movie
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,3.5,"Slightly a dip in the action sequences some of them looks too long should have focused more on the story like first two parts but still it is great when it comes to camera angles ,cinematography , places where it is shooted."
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,4,"John Wick 3 proves once again the lead actors love for wonderfully directed and exhilarating action sequences in a dazzling, yet relentless installment that feels speedy, and sometimes in conflict with what the story try to communicate."
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,5,Great Action and Great Story!
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,3.5,What I find interesting is that some people write comments long enough about a movie to be a screenplay unto themselves. Who cares enough about any movie to write a book of criticism unless you're actually getting paid to do so. Fighting in the movies still pretty good but realism out the window. Apparently this is an alternate universe we're looking at where the crime Lords pretty much run the world don't really see too many cops or just ordinary everyday people seems like everybody's an assassin
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,5,Absolutely a marvelous movie. Definitely worth seeing.
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,4.5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,5,Amazing sequel had everything I wanted great action more characters and more info on his world I love this franchise it delivers every time.
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,3,not my cup of tea. but it's so well done that it provides a level of escapism that makes it worth a watch. and the next one when it comes.
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,4,I'm can't really put in words what makes this movie so good. The story isn't exactly compelling and the characters are average.
John Wick: Chapter 3 -- Parabellum,3.5,It was all right but the weakest out of the three.
It Follows,4,"A surprisingly great movie.  It maybe a lower budget film but the story didn't need a large budget to told.  The story is unique, the acting is well done, the pacing is good and the effects leave you unnerved."
It Follows,3.5,Interesting concept. I enjoyed it.
It Follows,0.5,"Simplesmente horrível, não faz sentido nenhum e não dá medo. É uma perda de tempo"
It Follows,4,Such an amazing take on a cool horror theme.
It Follows,2.5,"Maybe I was a victim of high expectations, but It Follows was a disappointment. It does feature an intriguing and original premise in a copycat genre, plus some nice camerawork. However, there are problems with character development, pacing, underwhelming special effects, and ludicrous strategies by the protagonists. Most fundamentally, It Follows just isn't that scary."
It Follows,4,"Some of the best movie monsters are the ones that the protagonists alone can see, or that they have to convince others are real. All of a sudden the threat evolves from a single entity to an entire oppressive atmosphere, with people questioning their sanity or being left terrifyingly isolated to deal with an imminent danger."
It Follows,2,"I honestly can't understand why people like this films, it is uninspiring, slow paced, and trying to turn a STD into a ghost is just kinda silly"
It Follows,2.5,Could've been better with a genesis backstory of how all this came about.
It Follows,2,"Ugh, Rotten Tomatoes effs me up again. What a waste of time. Plodding and ridiculous and completely meaningless. Thanks a lot RT. You are becoming more and more unreliable. You give this movie 96%???? Seriously???? If you had given it 46%, I still would have been annoyed, but at least it wouldn't have led me to believe I was going to have wowed out of my mind. Ugh."
It Follows,5,Possibly the scariest movie I have ever seen.
The Lost Daughter,2.5,"In my opinion, arty films that move at a snail's pace require a big payoff at the end to justify their existence.  This one's ending didn't come close.  On the plus side, the acting is pretty good all around."
Malignant,2.5,It was.... interesting. I saw the twist coming from about 10 minutes into the film and it was so easily guessable.
Malignant,1.5,Bad dialogue. Bad CGI. Bad acting. Bad wig. Meh story.
Malignant,3,What a batshit fun ride
Malignant,1.5,"Started this movie and made the decision five minutes in that we'd only watch it to make fun of the terribly cheesy writing. Kept it up through the whole thing, and nothing felt redeeming about it. Debated a few times whether to just give up and stop watching. Predictable twists, shitty CGI and lines that made me choke in their awfulness. Truly terrible. The only positive thing I have to say? We did actually make it through the whole thing."
Malignant,5,I really loved this movie. It is wierd and original and completely bonkers! James wan's directing is spectacular and it has a superb twist in the end.
Malignant,4,This is a good monster movie. Some of the special effects were bad though. But its a good story and has lots of gore..
Malignant,5,"Thrillingly intense and entertaining gore fest with brilliant music and amazing story, the concept was great, The 1st half was pure horror and 2nd half was awesome R rated mayhem with mind-blowing twists and an satisfying end. Its a great movie!"
Malignant,3,"Malignant is a ride, one that changes directions in multiple different ways that I did not expect. This film is an ambitious genre bend that takes tropes from slashers (loved the Friday the 13th/Halloween cords used in the beginning of the film), the classic James Wan ghost films, action, and strangely enough some elements from Scream in the comedy side. With some many different themes it was hard to really understand what this movie's identity was. The film had a serious tone throughout but had some awkward lines that felt right out of a Scream film. With those two different tones it felt as if the lines were funny bad writing rather than artistic vision."
Malignant,0.5,I lost iq points from the surprise ending
Knives Out,5,"As a complete Agatha Christie/Arthur Conan Doyle nut myself, I can't help but be a little skeptical walking into a murder mystery brought to life. Safe to say, Knives Out absolutely surpassed my expectations. Funny, interesting, puzzling with subtle social commentary the movie really does do it all. And of course, this star studded cast truly delivered."
Knives Out,3.5,"Pretty much enjoyed this Agatha Christie like mystery murder thing. It wasn't all that clever but it was jaunty enough. Daniel Craig's accent though…no, just no. Anna on the other hand…yes, just yes."
Knives Out,5,"This movie is so rewatchable!! Every time I watch it again, I fall in love with it again"
Knives Out,3.5,"Funny, occasionally thrilling, but not an outstanding mystery thriller."
Knives Out,5,Knives Out - How to do a Plot Twist
Knives Out,4.5,"This murder mystery film is a great watch.  With an increasingly likeable lead, and well chosen supporting cast, it is entertaining from start to finish.  Don't scroll through social media while watching though!  Typical of a whodunnit, Knives out requires undivided attention in order to follow the plot.  Whether you know who did it early on or are thoroughly suprised at the end, the sequence of events is enough to keep one entertained.  I would very much recommend this movie for adults and teens as there is minimal violence and gore, but not children due to some sexual references and language.  The plot will also likely not interest them.  Overall, ""Knives Out"" is a great film."
Knives Out,5,"Just rewatched this masterpiece. This movie shows you that you dont need crazy action/CGI battle to build tension, those last 30 minutes are just thrilling. Everytime Daniel Craig says something with his accent, i just laughed, not because it is bad, but because it is just so charismatic. The screenplay of this movie is fenemonal, just one of the best. The plot twist at the end is one of the best ever done, Ana de Armas is great, as well as Chris Evans. The camera work is insane, the cinematography is gorgeous and the location itself is just a character of its own, i love this movie ever since i was it."
Knives Out,5,"Fantastic. It provided a solid well written good old murder mystery, while also delivering some laughs along the way. 5/5 Stars, I would recommend to any murder mystery fan."
Knives Out,3.5,Funny. Emotional and Entertaining.
Knives Out,0.5,Only movie I've ever walked out of.
Forrest Gump,5,"I think this movie is a classic  (yeah 199r movie a classic now) Tom hanks outstanding performance is second to none, a skill few have many aim for, there so many great stories molded into an classic movie, easy watching and something everyone should see, aged not so good mabe (2022 now), but you won't notice after 10 mins,"
Forrest Gump,5,Um dos melhores filmes que retratam uma pessoa autista que eu ja vi
Forrest Gump,5,Simplesmente incrível
Forrest Gump,5,One of my favorite movies of all time. Such a likeable story and kept my attention the whole movie. Each character had its own great story and these characters feel like a part of you in the end. 10/10 would recommend without a doubt.
Forrest Gump,5,"A sentimental, funny, and entertaining look at this utterly fascinating life of fictional Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks Oscar-winning performance walks a very fine line, alternating  between cutesy and cloying to bringing pathos and depth in the lead role. Robin Wright and Gary Sinise were terrific, and Robert Zemeckis brings his knack for seamless visual effects to give scale and scope to an intimate tear-jerker. Luckily, this is a tear-jerker that works"
Forrest Gump,4.5,"outside the assessment of the cinematographic context, I think the director and writer gave a lot of good values about how to deal with life, especially in dealing with other people, one of the inspirational films that must be watched."
Forrest Gump,5,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. How can this be 71% on Rotten Tomatoes? The critics have lost their mind. How is this problematic? Give me a break. It's awesome on every level. Amazing acting, directing and storytelling."
Forrest Gump,5,"A great film. Not only well directed but well acted. We see some iconic scenes which have gone down as iconic in this industry. Furthermore, the time jumps really help build this film letting you catch up with Forest in different periods of his life. This film is an emotional flick making you care for the characters."
Forrest Gump,5,"Forrest Gump may not be for every movieviewer. But I know it is definitely a movie for me. The talent of all of the actors and the emotion they convey is incredible. This movie manages to be funny, mature and heartfelt. One of my favorite movies in cinema history."
Forrest Gump,5,REALLY FANTASTIC !!!
Thor: The Dark World,5,The greatest action-packed 01 hour: and 51 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thor: The Dark World,3.5,"Thor: The Dark World sets a new low for Marvel--one that is still very high, however. A good movie, a not-so-great Marvel movie. It keeps its balance thanks to the cast, but wobbles a lot due to slow pacing, boring plotlines, and lazy writing. If anything, this proves that Thor needs a re-work to finally find his place in the MCU."
Thor: The Dark World,3.5,"This film gets a bad rep, but it honestly has some of the best character interactions of any Thor movie. The main issue is the mostly unexciting plot unfortunately."
Thor: The Dark World,3.5,One of the worst marvel films but that doesn't mean it's terrible.
Thor: The Dark World,5,"I loved this segment of Thor and especially the contributions made to this film by the entire cast. I know some folks weren't crazy about this film but I sure was. Christopher Eccleston was wonderful as Malekith even though he may not have felt the same way for whatever reasons. It's all in the eye of the beholder!! Some critics thought the movie plot to be weak, I beg to differ. It was entertaining to me and as usual, the original cast did not disappoint. I respect the critics but just like the rest of us, we have our own opinions. Kudos to the entire cast on this film!"
Thor: The Dark World,1,I almost fell asleep through this snoozer of an early MCU hiccup. Nothing here is very interesting except Loki and I forgot almost everything in this movie that wasn't mentioned in Endgame.
Thor: The Dark World,3.5,"Not the best plot wise but I wouldn't say it's one of the worst Marvel movies. Yes, I only watch it for Loki's part in it but I don't see a problem with that. Loki and Thor's dynamic in this movie is so fun to watch and some of the very best one-liners in the MCU are made in here!"
Thor: The Dark World,3,"It has It's Moments., Heart-whelming and Curious."
Thor: The Dark World,5,"This is actually a really beautiful movie about children learning to break away from toxic family dynamics. I didn't like how Frigga got fridged, but the music, scenery and characters are excellent. I loved Jane contributing to saving the day with science, not power. I loved Thor realizing his father and his realm aren't those perfect golden icons he was taught in childhood. I loved everything regarding Loki. I loved this movie, its themes and poignancy. The scene with Loki on the throne, full of potential, of expectations, is the last scene of the MCU Thor franchise for me. Anything that comes after is unable to hold up."
Thor: The Dark World,2.5,"I remember the Aether and Malekith, that's about it."
American Psycho,4,Great movie and great acting.  Christian Bale really showed his skill in this.  Everyone else did great too but I was most surprised by how well Bale carried the whole movie.
American Psycho,5,Because I want to fit in
American Psycho,5,"""My name is Sarthak Bharad and I believe in watching good cinema."
American Psycho,4.5,Really good and awesome acting!
The Age of Adaline,5,"Started off a little slow, but man as you get into the storyline it gets immensely philosophical. It has a great meaning behind it if you truly pay attention. It's much more than just a woman who falls in love with a father and his son 50 years apart, it's about the possibility of loving someone no matter what the challenge is, it's a true tear jerking love story that can make even the numbest of people believe that true love is real."
The Age of Adaline,5,"Nostalgic, moody, beautiful cinematography and picture... This movie feels like a cozy book."
The Age of Adaline,4,Really good movie - Faith
The Age of Adaline,3.5,"Lively's acting is remarkable, she never disappoints in her work, i very much admire her for playing every character differently and unique. so many messages to pass along, like how your past must not affect your present or how moving on and letting go can make you see life worth living it even if u felt hopeless or nostalgic of the past. your memories must not hold you back! live a full life, just like you deserve! although this movie was romantic and touching, i felt like in a situation like that Adaline's personality would have been different from what she appears to be. but anyway that's why it's called fiction, so i really recommend this, for sure a worth watching movie!"
The Age of Adaline,3.5,"Well made and handsome looking, but rather dull initially. The film doesn't really come to life until Ford enters the scene as the Lively character's lost love. At that point the actors, as well as the film's tone, both effectively hit their stride. Frankly however, the fantasy element wasn't really necessary to making the film's themes work. For example, viewers shouldn't need to rely on spotty narration to fill in gaps—such as the pointless scientific explanation for Lively's fairy tale inspired longevity. Worthwhile for the various actor's strong work, particularly in the final act."
The Age of Adaline,4,I loved Blake Lively's elegant portrayal of Adaline. I've watched the movie a couple of times and find it soothing. Similar to Meet Joe Black. Harrison ford is lovely in this and the narration is so comforting. This movie is not for everyone but I think it's a great movie.
The Age of Adaline,5,"Every time I see this movie, it's as if it's my first time watching. The story is very captivating. Highly recommend."
The Age of Adaline,0.5,"The plot was painfully predictable and the unnecessary, pseudo-scientific explanations by the narrator were just annoying. "
The Age of Adaline,2,What a muddle!
The Age of Adaline,4,A perfect mix of genre and symbolic representation of life in a literally timeless notion of the purpose of our time on this planet.
Jurassic World,3.5,My rating for the film is a 7.3/10
Jurassic World,5,I really liked the direction they took with this movie. It was fun.
Jurassic World,4.5,"Nostalgica, entretenida, sorpresivamente bien estructurada en el aspecto argumental."
Jurassic World,4.5,"Ich bin ein Fan der gesamten Jurassic Reihe und Jurassic World ist absolut sehenswert. Gute Darsteller, Nick Robinson kann sein Potenzial noch steigern. Und ein sehr guter Schauspieler werden."
Jurassic World,2.5,Fun to see on the big screen but lacks the magic the original had while trying so hard to emulate it.
Jurassic World,4,"Not great, but not terrible either. Good ideas and recycled concepts. The visuals are what saved this for me to give it such high marks. But boy did the follow up to this movie drop the ball."
Jurassic World,5,"We finally get to see the park open and it was definitely worth the wait! Jurassic world is immensely entertaining, action packed, and a true runner up to the original classic!"
Jurassic World,5,GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Jurassic World,4,Great Movie a lot like the original Jurassic Park but still different and holds its especially the effects and Chris Pratt does a great job making this movie funny and entertaining so does Bryce Dallas Howard I recommend it. 9/10
Jurassic World,0.5,"Chris Pratt is not a good actor, and the Jurrasic movies just cement that opinion"
The Suicide Squad,1,"My god, this film was so bad and so stupid."
The Suicide Squad,0.5,this movie was not worth the time making the movie. I don't understand what made them not want to bring back the original cast. I had such hopes for this movie and was very disappointed. John Cena's character and vocabulary were unnecessarily vulgar and (in layman's words) dumb. The intelligence in the first movie was not there in the second. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
The Suicide Squad,4,"With ""The Suicide Squad "", James Gunn took what the previous movies in the franchise were trying to do and he finally succeeded at it.  Sort of a hard R ""Guardians of the Galaxy""."
Marry Me,2.5,"Downright nonsensical premise, almost gets there but is wayyy too formulaic."
Marry Me,0.5,"I'm surprised Jennifer Lopez's head didn't explode at the end of the movie. What a waste of time, do not recommend at all. Just a whole movie about people begging to kiss her feet, seems self centered. Owen Wilson plays a sad character that knows he's gunna be a short divorce away at best."
Black Widow,4.5,"Black Widow doesn't have many glaring issues--but the ones it does have stick out like a sore thumb. While having a great cast with great chemistry, and a nice progressive undertone, its treatment of the villain disappointed many fans, which is why it may be shoved to the sidelines by other big Marvel titles. However, what it gets right is really good, like its action, its setting, and Scarlett Johansson."
Black Widow,4.5,One of the best movies in the Marvel franchise. The bond between the female leads makes this a fun and entertaining movie that pulls at your heartstrings as well as you to the edge of your seat. The family dynamic is orchestrated perfectly and therefore keeps you from wanting to look away from the screen. A must-see for any Marvel fan
Black Widow,3.5,My rating for the film is a 7.9/10
Black Widow,2.5,"If this movie came up a little bit early I think it might be good. But unfortunately, this movie came after the event of avenger: endgame, and this movie feel empty because the black widow's sacrifices in the endgame really emotional. Watching this movie is like seeing a dead character and for me is not a great feeling. This movie exists only to set up Yelena's character in a future film. Overall the story is decent and the good thing about this movie is just the action scene is kinda great."
Black Widow,5,I love this movie because we got to know more of Natasha's past and her other family that she loves.
Black Widow,4,I love Marvel Movies so....... I loved it! Female superhero LOVE EM!
Black Widow,2.5,got made to late and kind of boring
Black Widow,3,The beginning of this film captured the essence of what I wanted the rest of it to be. Unfortunately it was toned down; there could have been more seriousness included to truly shine.
Black Widow,3.5,A fun spy thriller that came 5+ years too late. They shouldn't have waited till this character was dead to give her a film of her own. It serves to introduce Florence Pugh's Yelena who is a great character performed well by her.
Black Widow,2,"Disney siendo Disney, aburridísima, con incongruencias de guion, los personajes desaprovechados, CGI malo, otra película dirigida a niños sin sangre, ni acción ni nada de coreografías decentes. Mala suerte por Scarlett."
Seven,4.5,Kevin Spacey is MVP of the whole poha
Seven,5,This movie inspired me to create my own video and learn how to record and edit movies.
Nightmare Alley,2,"dafoe how could you? no. the story was interesting, sort of. the cast besides dafoe get some weird parts :/ the sets and stuff were cool. i liked the guy eats the chicken. yes a man eats a chicken. i want to see that part again, and dafoe's parts. this movie made me sad mostly for bradley cooper who's the most talented. he tried this new director guillermo toro. but it's too weird and the plot gets tiresome. i like the attempt though."
Nightmare Alley,3.5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
Nightmare Alley,1.5,"The great cinematography that captured the time period wasn't enough to make up for the boring characters and storyline.  We stopped at our ""make it or break it"" 30 minutes into the film.  If it didn't grab us by then, it wasn't going to."
The Green Knight,5,"Absolute masterpiece, very slow, thoughtful modern interpretation. Lots of long takes with beautiful scenery. The ending sequence is something else."
The Green Knight,2.5,"O cnotach. Niedosłowny w nieatrakcyjny sposób. Zalecana znajomość poematu ""Pan Gawen i Zielony Rycerz"". Upośledzona narracja. Ciekawy wizualnie. Wlecze się"
The Green Knight,1,Terrible movie. I'm not sure why they bothered to make this.
The Green Knight,4,"Visually and thematically striking adaptation, even if the filmmaker doesn't quite understand the original poem he's adapting."
The Green Knight,1,"It was really arty. Nothing happens. Bad story telling. Distracting music. Hard to read fonts. Felt like a school project from the early 80s. Maybe it would make sense if you already knew the story, but it's hard to understand what's happen or why it's happening and more importantly why should I care if it's happening or not? Don't waste your time on this one unless maybe you're a real nerd for Arthurian legends"
The Green Knight,4,"The Green Knight is an epic character study that takes it's time following the path of a man finding worth in his life, but that slow progression is also its downfall."
The Green Knight,5,"A beautiful, strange, and remarkable film that - if viewed simply as a work of adaptation of a 'difficult' text - may well be a masterpiece. It's certainly as good a filmed adaptation of a (middle) English chivalric romance poem as anyone could reasonably expect. Marketed as an adventure fantasy, that expectation will likely lead to disappointment; expect something lyrical, poetic, and hard to forget and you're in the right territory. Dev Patel is outstanding in a complex, difficult role (and Alicia Vikanda also deserves recognition, making an excellent job in a key supporting role). Really every department should be highlighted; I especially thought the superb, and every visual aspect of the film works wonderfully. It's a gorgeous and haunting film to look at. Its clarity of vision and willing embrace of many of the poem's themes mean it will likely richly reward revisiting. A wonderful piece of film-making."
The Green Knight,5,great modern medieval movie
The Green Knight,2.5,History goes everywhere and at the same time nowhere. The script doesn't seem very solid but the performances are good. The best thing is definitely the scenarios and what the film visually has to offer.
The Green Knight,5,This film is a reminder why i love movies.
Parasite,4,I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT PLOT TWIST
Margin Call,5,"this film should be set as text book in film school in terms of acting, dialog, and story flow."
Margin Call,5,"A staggering movie that draws you in and doesn't let go. The dialogue is witty, delicious and sharp. Beautifully acted. Tense and engrossing, it'll churn around in your head for days."
Margin Call,4,"I wanted a more technical explanation of the financial problem discovered-obviously the script refers to the derivative debacle that caused the 08 crash, but I'm probably the only one that did and by the end of the movie I didn't care.  A scathing indictment of American capitalism and a dark chilling look at the American workplace (everyone both has their price and is entirely dispensable). Anyone who has ever worked in a large corporate environment will immediately identify with the way the plot line moves up the food chain in the corporate world.  Great acting all around, especially Kevin Specey, Jeremy Irons and Stanley Tucci."
The King's Man,2.5,"Better than the second one, and since it's a prequal it could be shown before the first movie and still just forget the sequel ever happened.  It is good but not great so the first one would still be amazing."
Spree,3.5,"I had heard that they called this movie ''American Psycho of the Digital age'' I thought it was a somewhat wrong comparison but I was wrong. The first few minutes of the movie made me feel like I was watching a dark comedy just like in American Psycho but with a dull and stupid humor that I didn't quite like, at the end of it all the movie conveys the same message about wanting to fit in and be popular in the internet world, the execution was not what I expected, I think that a shorter and more significant ending could have been made but at the end of everything it ends up hitting the spot."
Spree,5,"Such a good movie, not dissapointing at all, the acting of Joe Keery was too good and there were almost no filling scenes at all because its action almost time."
Spree,4,I really liked the movie and kurt was cool
Spree,5,This was a funny movie. I really enjoyed it. I laughed so hard at some of the parts and the moral of the story was amazing. Dont try to go viral smh HAHAHAHAHAH
Spree,5,This movie is one of the greatest slasher/horror films I have ever seen it is the only one of these films that left me speechless by the time the credits rolled
Spree,5,A bonkers ride spoofing online content creators attempting to go viral by any means necessary.
The Last Duel,4.5,"The Last Duel is fantastic. I loved how Scott decided to craft all three sides to the story. It really allowed the viewer to gather pieces and clues in each retelling to come up with there own conclusion. The action in this movie is visceral, so many gruesome and gory shots. It had me exhaling during multiple fight sequences. Performances across the board were excellent. Jodie Comer, Matt Damon and Adam Driver were so freakin good, every scene was expertly done. Overall, really strong watch, one of the better medieval films I have seen in a very long time."
The Last Duel,2.5,It's not terrible. The set pieces are amazing. The final fight sequence is mesmerizing. The problem is the storyline is predictable to the point I just skipped the middle and didn't miss anything. The characters are simple to point of boredom.
The Last Duel,4,"Od początku do końca atrakcyjnie opowiadana dosyć zwyczajna historia. Świetnie zagrany. Fajne, brudne walki. Przydługawy"
The Last Duel,4.5,"The 3 perspective acts were Brilliant with slight change in pov and details, The story as chapters and the characters were amazingly written, The music and visuals of that era was great, The acting was amazing, the fights were brutal, the 3rd chapter ""The truth"" was dark and deep and the ending with duel was intense, Overall It's a great movie."
The Last Duel,4.5,It was fun to watch. Editing pulls you into the action. The fact that most of it based on real events makes it more interesting.
The Last Duel,3.5,"I really liked the idea of telling a story from 3 different perspectives. While Matt Damon's acting bothered me at times, I was able to get lost in the film and understand the main point it tries to make."
The Last Duel,3.5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
The Last Duel,1,An epic bore. A slow moving story that was overly long. Not worth the time.
The Last Duel,3.5,"The Last Duel is a powerful and well-crafted movie diving back into medieval France and focussing on a hard-hitting story. The cast is probably the best part of this film with wonderful performances from everyone and unique enough to be interesting for each one. The score is great at complementing the tone of the movie and giving weight to the characters as well, especially during interactions between different characters which definitely shine a light onto the portrayal of emotions by the cast. The story definitely resonates with you with its brutal telling of a tale and flows down many directorial nuances that make this movie interesting and engaging. This movie is definitely long but never feels as long as the actual runtime always keeps you hooked throughout every moment it can. The storytelling is also creative going between different chapters and the epic weight this movie has is definitely worth watching this movie for. However, things do seem to get repetitive and slightly monotonic at points where it can draw you away and sometimes characters that are meant to be in focus get outshined by others which takes away from the weight that is being put on them. Nevertheless, even with slight gripes, The Last Duel lends itself as an epic movie that should definitely be experienced."
The Last Duel,4.5,"This movie is great, i would normally give it 5/5 but I am very aware it will ""drag"" for some. I dont mind when movies slow down as long as they keep me interested. Some will not like this aspect though for sure"
The Gray Man,5,"I thought the movie was great, if you go into it expecting dialogue and story-telling on the levels of Godfather than yes you'll be disappointed but if you go in being more reasonable for this kind of movie and just expect to be lost in another world and it's amazing action then you're going to love this."
Rubikon,2,"The Good:  You do get approx 10 minutes of nice space scenes.   The sets look pretty good as well.    The Bad:  But I disliked the story and the obvious agenda.  Boring, cliched, obvious.  I really disliked George Blagden performance in this.  I had previously really enjoyed his role on Vikings. The other two actors do fine to good with their roles.    I would recommend Aniara for an overall superior story of similar subject matter which is much more engaging and better performed and without the hammer of the head messaging."
Rubikon,1,"Terrible. Stupid plot, bad acting. Stay away"
Rubikon,5,"Many of the reviewers here probably aren't used to Sci-Fi films which ask philosophical questions. This film is beautiful visually, has an interesting plot, great acting, and asks these tough questions throughout. There were no points during the movie where I was bored or lost interest. The characters had multiple crises to deal with from beginning to end. "
Rubikon,5,Not bad si-fi movie. Want more of this!!!
Rubikon,0.5,"incredible boring, a total sleeping pill, bad acting, waste of time."
Rubikon,2.5,Don't waste time on this long-winding with no direction.
Rubikon,0.5,I thought I was in a woodwork class. Not an ounce of acting ability or credible writing to back up what could have been a decent flick.
Rubikon,4.5,Interesting premise of evil corporations dominating and eventually ruining the world.
Rubikon,3,"Formulaic and underwhelming but still entertains.  Very similar story & character arcs to ""Black Crab."""
Rubikon,5,"Rubikon is not your average ""disaster, watched from the space station"" movie. It is a 3-person chamber play about decisions you have to make in the aftermath.  It starts intriguing and slows then down to an atmospheric drama that tries to stay on the foundations of human behavior. Very entertaining for a grown-up audience not in need for shootouts or madness in space."
12 Angry Men,5,"Works brilliantly as a court room drama, a fascinating legal procedural, a tense character-driven drama, and an actor's showcase overflowing with acting riches. Director Sidney Lumet handles the material here just perfectly. Loved this film"
12 Angry Men,4.5,"9/10 perfect rhythm, acting, directing"
12 Angry Men,5,Masterpiece. Should be a mandatory viewing at all schools.
12 Angry Men,4,"Compelling, sophisticated, and very attentive to the minor details. This is a realistically convincing film with superb scripting. The only reason I'm not rating more than 4 stars is to leave an upper hand for Murder on the Orient Express, which in my opinion Sidney Lumet excelled at, and this is my way of recognizing that and giving it its right."
12 Angry Men,4.5,93/100 -------------
12 Angry Men,5,A flawless masterpiece
12 Angry Men,5,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and is just as relevant today as when it came out. Depicting one of the most base instincts of humanity, 12 Angry Men revels in the darkness of human nature and the possibility of hope (and salvation)."
12 Angry Men,5,"incredible, absolutely recommend"
12 Angry Men,4.5,You would think that a movie that takes place in a jury room for it's entirety would have it's boring moments but this movie simply does not. I love how it starts out with each character being relatable and friendly and then turns into each of them showing emotionally how they feel about the case. The writing is really impressive and all of the actors (not just Henry Fonda) did an amazing job at making their characters seem as realistic as possible.
12 Angry Men,5,A courtroom masterpiece and brilliant acting great chemistry
36,3,"Il y a quelque chose de très étrange dans les films d'Olivier Marchal. Il est très compliqué de détourner les yeux de l'écran, surtout quand Gérard Depardieu est présent et même si Daniel Auteuil n'est pas crédible une seule seconde, mais il est impossible d'être réellement satisfait devant 36 Quai des Orfèvres. Cela est dû à un niveau de dialogue proche du néant, avec des phrases toutes faites qui enchaînent les grossièretés comme des perles comme pour faire plus vrai. C'est plutôt tour à tour atterrant et hilarant. Heureusement, les quelques scènes d'action sont plutôt bien fichues, la première partie du film est assez réussie et l'intrigue pas trop stupide. Mais Olivier Marchal, pour tout son goût du nihilisme consacré dans Bronx, fait vraiment toujours la même chose, toujours le même film et de ce fait, le suspense censé être présent ne l'est jamais. Surtout qu'il met ses rebondissements en scène de manière si grandiloquente que ça en devient souvent ridicule. 36 Quai des Orfèvres, c'est du cinéma benêt, mais pas désagréable pour autant."
36,0.5,"I got suckered into watching this utterly stupid movie because of the high scores on this site and on IMDb.  Good lord, this was absolutely dreadful.  This is honestly one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.  The plot is laughable dreck that stretches credulity  far beyond the breaking point.  I am convinced that most of the good reviews are from people who worked on the movie.  Not even close to Heat in any way.  This movie wishes it was even 1/100000000th as good as Heat.  This movie wishes it was even 1/1000th as good as a direct-to-video Steven Seagal movie.  Blech."
36,5,"A perfect cop thriller. Twists, turns all tie together"
36,5,First class in every way. Hugely entertaining.
36,4,Bad ass crime movie.
36,3,Guerre des chefs & flics borderline.
36,4.5,uno dei migliori visti di recente
36,4,"Can't quite believe this is a 10 yr old film --Gerard Depardieu is one bad mutha. Well directed, lots of sadistic baddies, and action-packed. Some of the scenes (and the score) can be a bit manipulative, deliberately (and gratuitously) tucking heartstrings, but its dark, gritty, and very good."
36,2,The tune that best represents my review of this film is... B. B. King's The Thrill Is Gone!
36,4.5,Can't believe I hadn't seen this one before...
4 Little Girls,1.5,"All dol respect to the victims - of this senseless act of cowardice, but it really was a snooze. I understand that there needs to be time given to talk about the family members and so on, but I really could not keep myself engaged while all of that was going on. I do know that in '97 things weren't 100% what they are now in TV but still, all the reasons in the world wouldn't make this interesting and God knows there is a lot to dive into with a church bombing."
4 Little Girls,4,Watched this tonight on what is the 57th anniversary of the Birmingham church bombing. Excellent documentary with interviews of the families affected by this senseless terrorist act. There is a clip with Bill Cosby being interviewed though that I'll bet Spike wishes he could take back.
4 Little Girls,5,"Spike takes us on an incredible journey!  We all know what happened.  But by the time he weaves us in and out of their lives and paints the backdrop of the social climate they lived in, we are completely entrenched.  When the event unfolds in the film, these are our four little cousins, our four sisters, or the four girls who live next door. Our hearts and minds are completely invested. As. They. Should. Be."
4 Little Girls,5,It was a very heartfelt movie i found out alot of truths 
4 Little Girls,4,"Spike Lee's documentary about the 1963 bombing of a church in BIrmingham, Alabama that killed 4 young girls is an appropriately quiet and direct telling of the events leading up to the tragedy and it's aftermath.  Lee interviews family, friends and other witnesses and largely lets their words speak for themselves.  He briefly uses morgue photos of the 4 girls to hammer home exactly what a senseless act like this does.  It's a frustrating and infuriating film and it should be.  It's one of his better films of the last 30 years."
4 Little Girls,3.5,"I wasn't a huge fan of the music - it was a little distracting at times. However, the movie was very powerful."
4 Little Girls,4,The story is heartbreaking but told so well.
4 Little Girls,5,A must see documentary about the tragic bombing at 16th Street Baptist Church in Alabama on Sunday 15th of September 1963 that took four innocent African American girls lives.
4 Little Girls,5,A moving story about a great tragedy. This whole presentation was done beautifully!!! I have watched it several times!!!
4 Little Girls,5,"Spike was robbed,should have gotten the Oscar, ""Into the Arms of Strangers"" notwithstanding. These four girls are America's Anne Franks, and this film should be seen widely, by families, in schools, everywhere. Done with more delicacy than Mr Lee usually allows himself."
99 River Street,4,"Well made, well acted and good plot.  Really an underrated gem."
99 River Street,3.5,"John Payne stars as a washed-up fighter who makes ends meet by driving a cab; when his two-timing wife turns up dead in the back seat, he finds himself both on the run from the law (he's the primary suspect) and heading toward a showdown with the actual killer, his wife's jewel thief lover.  Payne is riveting, tough in one scene, tormented in the next; Evelyn Keyes as the actress pal who falls for him is spunky and resourceful and altogether excellent; and Peggie Castle brings just the right amount of thinly-veiled frustration to the small but pivotal role of the wife.  Inventive camera work and gorgeous black-and-white shots of darkened, rain-slicked streets--courtesy of ace cinematographer Franz Planer--make this a noir fan's dream.  (The fight scenes--including the beautifully shot prizefight that opens the film--are something to see, too.)  Well worth a look."
99 River Street,5,"A former boxer turned cab driver has to hide from the police when his badgering wife is murdered by the jewel thief she was having an affair with.A terrific overlooked noir. Phil Karlson directed series of very tough, violent film noirs, but few of them are as tough and violent as the superb 99 River Street. "
99 River Street,4.5,Pretty good B-movie with plenty of the requisite plot twists. Refreshing to see a cabbie that refuses all fares.
99 River Street,3,"John Payne plays a washed-up boxer driving a cab who catches his wannabe gold-digger wife with another guy.  This sets the wheels in motion and the screws gradually tighten on Payne in true noir style.  Turns out the other guy is a diamond thief who has trouble with his fence and the fence's tough guy assistant (played by noir stalwart Jack Lambert) over Payne's wife's involvement in the heist.  When she turns up dead, the cops come looking for Payne.  After having reality literally ripped away from him in one crazy scene, he has to use his knuckles to fight his way to the truth.  Director Phil Karlson knows his noir sets (see also Dark Alibi, Kansas City Confidential, or The Phenix City Story) and he lays them all out for us here (late night drug store, boxing ring, all-night café, waterfront, expensive upper class apartment, neon lit or darkened streets of New York, and unusually the Broadway footlights).  Perhaps there isn't as much a sense of dread as in other 1950s noirs and perhaps Payne is a little too wooden in the lead but for solid genre fare, look no further."
99 River Street,3.5,decent noir. great performance by Payne
99 River Street,4,Bravo for this great B movie!
99 River Street,4,"Great acting all around, and the plot is interesting as well, with some interesting twists and turns along the way."
99 River Street,3.5,"Monday, October 28, 2013"
99 River Street,4,"Reliable director Phil Karlson knocks out another tough solid noir about an ex-boxer, now cabbie, who is framed for the murder of his wife and tries to find the real murderer while on the run from the cops."
A Christmas Carol,5,"This is the classic I grew up with and we always look for it and it's always on late on Christmas Eve.  It's just a sweet movie with a great message.  And for it's time, the special effects are very very good."
A Christmas Carol,3.5,A Christmas Carol is a 1938 American film adaptation of Charles Dickens's 1843 novella of the same name 🎄 
A Christmas Carol,4,"A lot of its satisfaction now comes from looking back in history at a time when the Christmas spirit flourished with long held tradition. You can't get that kind of atmosphere anymore, it's in a time capsule, which this film beautifully showcases. This slice of history tells the classic tale in its truest form, taking dialogue straight from the book and embellishing the lives of the Cratchits and Scrooge's nephew just enough to have a fuller film with proper character development. "
A Day in the Country,2,A pointless short film about nothing much.
A Day in the Country,3.5,"Though I enjoyed the craft a decent bit more than the central romance, I still liked this film quite a lot. Technically speaking, it packs a strong punch. For example, Rodolphe opening a window to find Henriette swinging felt like an alluring artistic tableau, while the famous rain scene stuck out as one of the most beautiful portrayals of the passage of time I've seen in film. Also, when I rewatched it, I noticed that several scenes had an undercurrent of fatalism, one which hinted that the apparent end wasn't the actual end. These bits got under my skin pretty well and a third viewing may reveal more examples of this. In regard to the romance between Henri and Henriette, it was brief (what can you do; it was only 40 minutes), but one gets the impression from it that Henriette felt more at ease with Henri as opposed to Anatole. Unfortunately though, as is a trapping with many classic films, the film had a layer of sexism. In one scene, Henri forced himself on Henriette despite her trying to get him to stop. Shortly afterwards though, she fell for this creepy behavior and willingly kissed him in return. This left a sour taste in my mouth which lasted throughout the ending, as I didn't care much for their relationship at that point. Also, though I'm not sure this was the case, it seemed like Rodolphe looked up Henriette's skirt while she was on the swing, which was another creepy scene presented as romantic. In spite of this, however, I still think the film has plenty to offer that its worth a watch."
A Day in the Country,3.5,A simple but powerfully restricted romance that builds up a deceptive bulk of superficiality before delving all too briefly into a sincere tretise on disturbing the calm of surface-level happiness to satisfy a deeper desire. (3.5/5)
A Day in the Country,4.5,"Charming, bittersweet comedy directed by Jean Renoir."
A Day in the Country,4.5,A beautifully charming well made French film. 1001 movies to see before you die.
A Day in the Country,4,"This is a beautiful short film from the great Jean Renoir.  Though made in 1936, it still feels relevant and is just a beautiful and simple story, very well told.  The scenery and cinematography are gorgeous.  My only complaint is the character/actor of Anatole, every time he was on screen he made me cringe, but otherwise this is a short masterpiece!"
A Day in the Country,4,"A family from Paris spend a day in the country, where a couple of local gents conspire to romance the daughter under the nose of her fiance.  A short, beautifully bittersweet vignette from Renoir based on a Guy de Maupassant story."
A Day in the Country,4.5,A short piece of art by Jean Renoir
A Day in the Country,5,"From a 40-minute rural film that begins so light-heartedly, the genius of director Jean Renoir is the powerful emotions of sadness and remorse he weaves it."
A Day in the Country,3.5,"A quick touching love story. Due to its short length, it does not bog down too much in excess, but gets right to the point."
A Foreign Affair,3.5,"Ostensibly a romantic comedy, the film works better as a slice-of-life look at Berlin in the immediate aftermath of World War II.  Arthur and Dietrich are their usual wonderful selves, but I felt John Lund lacked the acting chops and charisma needed for his role."
A Foreign Affair,5,The best comedy movie ever made!
A Foreign Affair,4,"What an interesting, conflicting film this is.  Jean Arthur plays a congresswoman visiting Germany after the war to check up on the troops stationed there.  Marlene Dietrich is a cabaret singer rumored to have been a mistress of one of the top Nazis, and now carrying on an affair with an American officer (John Lund).  As Arthur probes into Dietrich, Lund tries to run interference by getting involved with her romantically, thus setting up a love triangle."
A Foreign Affair,3,A unique rom-com that showcases war torn Berlin and the dynamics that were faced by those trying to survive.  I mostly saw it to see the Congressional oversight perspective.
A Foreign Affair,3.5,It is difficult to have an ethic in difficult times...
A Foreign Affair,5,"Great, great film, with an amazing cast--Millard Mitchell at his best--and Billy Wilder, too."
A Foreign Affair,4,"Billy Wilder's look at postwar Berlin is, at turns, harrowing and yet romantic. A team of naive congressmen comes to ""inspect"" the reported moral degradation of our good ol' 'Murican boys there keeping the peace, infected by common Euro trash elitists. Jean Arthur bravely plays the plain and ordinary girl-next-door pitted against the sophisticated and worldly Marlene Dietrich. Layered and complex, always entertaining, and a window on a different time, here is a keeper."
A Foreign Affair,3,It has somewhat flawed morals and characters in my opinion but then again real life rarely produces heroes like we see in other movies. It is a little entertaining. Jean Arthur (48) could pass for a 27-year old.
A Foreign Affair,2.5,"not sure why the fascination with Dietrich, and the script is pure corn."
A Foreign Affair,4.5,Set in Berlin Germany after the war
A Kiss Before Dying,3.5,"Robert Wagner's character might be one of cinema's worst serial killers, but the film is a good study of a psychopath. It is also cool to see the young Wagner and Joanne Woodward (her second film) working together."
A Kiss Before Dying,5,Really enjoyed this colour film noir and it has Jeffrey Hunter from Star Trek
A Kiss Before Dying,5,"A classic. The scenes of the University of Arizona, downtown Tucson, and the desert in the 1950s are breathtaking to see."
A Kiss Before Dying,3.5,"Robert Wagner basically played himself in this movie. Chilling to see him throw his rich girlfriend off a tall building the way he threw his rich wife Natalie Wood off a boat then staged it to look like ""an accident"" Life certainly imitates art, a must see!"
A Kiss Before Dying,2.5,"They should have made Joanne Woodward a twin. The girl who played her sister Ellen was horrendous,monotone. "
A Kiss Before Dying,1,Robert Wagner has the evil persona down pat.   He is best in these roles.
A Kiss Before Dying,4,"Robert Wagner plays a wonderfully smarmy, cold-hearted, evil douche-bag whom the audience is just waiting to see receive his comeuppance. Good stuff."
A Kiss Before Dying,3,"Robert Wagner playing against type is Budd Corliss, an ambitious, brilliant, and charming sociopath who is out to woo and marry the daughter of a wealthy mining magnate. He murders said girlfriend, Dorothy (Joanne Woodward) when her pregnancy eliminates his chances of being accepted by her wealthy but puritanical father and stages it to look like a suicide. Her sister Ellen (Virginia Leith) refuses to believe her sister committed suicide and investigates the case on her own when the police quickly close the book. Wagner is handsome and charming and manages a menacing quality to his portrayal of Budd; this is a forerunner to Norman Bates. With Mary Astor as Budd's very working class mother who expects great things of her son and an early performance by future Horror icon Robert Quarrie as a former boyfriend of Dorothy's. The script was adapted by Ira Levin from his novel by the same name."
A Kiss Before Dying,1,"Joanne Woodward supposedly called this the worst film ever made in Hollywood. It's pretty bad in all sorts of weird, clueless ways. For a motive that does not seem to warrant it, handsome young Bud decides he must kill pregnant wife-to-be Dorothy, and gives her a kiss before pushing her off the top of a building, thus fulfilling the promise of the title. Casting two lookalikes (Robert Wagner and a pipe-smoking Jeffrey Hunter) in the leading male roles adds a certain confusion. Casting two women who do not look alike at all (Virginia Leith and Ms. Woodward) as sisters Ellen and Dorothy adds more. The plots swerves from one neat, quick murder to another without much ado. Murder is so easy in ""A Kiss Before Dying."" Most ridiculous of all is the not-so-exciting climax, wherein Ellen, suspicious that her new beau is a serial killer, nevertheless goes to a remote location with him and stands on the edge of a cliff before confronting him with her suspicions. A struggle happens -- another kiss before dying! Fortunately, a wayward truck happens by just in time to push him off the cliff instead. Don't you hate it when that happens?"
A Kiss Before Dying,4,"Not bad, a bit dated, good acting by Wagner."
A Man Escaped,4,"I fairly dislike Bresson's unnamed motto, where he practically refused to tell the story by any other means but using purely cinematic tools. I've never felt, that making the characters act deadpan so as to not reduce yourself to theater acting, enhances his films. But that, was before I watched 'A Man Escaped'. Because filming it without any excess is exactly what makes it amazing. This movie leans so heavily on sound, in a way, that it's impossible to be depicted anywhere else but on a film screen. You almost never see the guards; you hear them, and the hushing up of the sound, that Fontaine makes is a crucial aspect of the escape. To the point where the crunch of gravel will make you anxious. This is the quintessential prison break story. With a very narrow focus and few characters, showing glimpses between passages of time. Where hours or days can pass between the scenes, and you wouldn't really know, unless Fontaine specifically tells you so. Operating in the limited space of the cell as he slowly, methodically recycles it into an escape plan is masterfully done. And in my opinion, this is the best Bresson film."
A Man Escaped,2.5,"The style could not be more refined, but the adaptation suffered excessively for it. The first work by Bresson that I see surprised me but did not seem sublime. The voiceover was too cumbersome instead of simplifying. 5/10"
A Man Escaped,4.5,"Damn fine effort at slowly building the tension. Not a flashy escape film, relatively slow paced without ever losing its grip on you. A great prisoner of war film."
A Man Escaped,4.5,"Bresson's use of tight, confined shots provide the atmosphere, while the largely emotionless dialogue coupled with the omnipresent threat of swift, yet stoic, retribution for dissent establishes the stakes for this fantastic and involving thriller. If the exaggerated, distorted, somewhat jolly piece of entertainment that is the Great Escape can be considered the definitive American WW2 prison break film, then A Man Escaped is the same for French New Wave, taking advantage of every innovation that the movement promised to deliver a true classic. (4.5/5)"
A Man Escaped,5,The harsh realities of World War 2 prisons and an edge of the seat prison escape story. This movie is a classic by Robert Bresson.
A Man Escaped,4.5,"The pace of the movie is slow but it never fails to be interesting. The story really focuses on the details and that's what makes it feel very real and as if you were there. The actor's performance was fantastic, the fear in their eyes and body-language was very real."
A Man Escaped,4,An exercice in minimalism. A Man Escaped creates tension with nothing but sounds and lingering shots. Choosing to work with nonprofessional actors really helped to further the authenticity of a movie that is based on real life events.
A Man Escaped,3,"Director Robert Bresson's 'A Man Escaped' is the real-life story of André Devigny, a member of the French Resistance sent to Montluc prison by the Nazis, and is true to history.  The style is stark and minimalistic, and while that doesn't necessarily make it dated, I suspect it had much larger impact in 1956, just a decade after the war, than it does today (artistically and emotionally).  There are moments of real tension, starting with when the protagonist gets another prisoner assigned to his cell and wonders how to proceed with his escape plans, one option being to kill him.  There are unfortunately also moments of tedium.  Bresson is honest to the experience of imprisonment, but that doesn't make for riveting viewing.  The Nazi guards seem remarkably absent - we see them at times administering punishment briefly, or bringing food, but they are in the background, and if the film wasn't based on a true story, you might think it unrealistically so.  That may be part of the point, that there is an interior battle here, to never surrender hoping, to not give in, and to be brave, but when it's combined with under-stated emotion from the actors, I think it takes away from the realism that Bresson was striving for.  I wish the ending could have been expanded upon as well.  A solid film, but not one I'd want to watch again, or recommend without reservations."
A Man Escaped,3.5,"For a film thats main spoiler is the title itself, Bresson still manages to maintain a high level of suspense from the opening credits until the closing scene. This is due to the minimalistic nature of the film, the cinematography and dialogue are barebones so that every detail we are shown is purposeful and undeniably part of Fontaine's plan, and although an inexperienced actor at the time, the pathos demonstrated through François Leterrier and the persistence of his character make every little victory a meaningful landmark towards the inevitable escape."
A Man Escaped,5,"Film school for anyone who wants to make movies, A Man Escaped lays the down the bare essentials of the thriller movie, clearly identifying the do's and do not's and providing a necessary lesson in craftsmanship."
A Room With a View,2.5,"The rating largely reflects that I'm not into slow, dull, eventless, romantic, period dramas. Nothing happens but the acting is clearly excellent with a top draw cast. I just about got through it but it bored me senseless whereas others will lap it up."
A Room With a View,5,Surprisingly hilarious. great cast
A Room With a View,2.5,"This is a classic that probably didn't age well to my eyes. I wasn't familiar with the plot as I've never read the book, but despite its novelty for me I've found it too flat. I understand that the book was well-written and the film was well-made, but the standards have raised in both cases. Overall, for a tale that should've aroused my deepest emotions of freedom and passion, it was quite dull."
A Room With a View,3.5,"The movie meanders often, but it's a solid adaptation."
A Room With a View,3.5,"No matter how good these types of films can be, I think I'm tired of the posh english accent."
A Room With a View,1.5,"This romantic comedy/period piece has some of the biggest British thespians from a young Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, Maggie Smith, Daniel-Day Lewis, Denholm Elliot, andJudi Dench"
A Room With a View,3.5,"It took a couple of tries to get into it because for me, this is the kind of movie that you really have to pay attention to. However once that happened, I really enjoyed it. Loved Daniel Day Lewis as a rather odd character. Helena Bonham Carter is always good, and I can't say enough good things about Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. Surprisingly funny in some places and absolutely beautiful scenes of Florence and the countryside. I admit that some parts were kind of boring but the ending was absolutely wonderful"
A Room With a View,5,Now this is a movie!
A Room With a View,3.5,"Great performances all around, especially by Maggie Smith, makes this film worth watching."
A Room With a View,3.5,"Simple in its general premise, but far more entertaining than its Edwardian origin would indicate; plenty of satirizing of the prim and proper culture of the day that still feels solid. As a pure romance, it is fairly conventional, but many will find that facet to be comforting. Many of the supporting roles are particularly engrossing, Smith, Day-Lewis, and Callow most prominently. In 2020, there is another facet of interest - seeing the unexpected youth among a series of acting professionals that have made their marks in ensuing decades, particularly the exceptionally youthful Carter and Day-Lewis, but Smith and Dench (who are now go-to A-listers for refined matriarch characters) as well. (3.5/5)"
A Special Day,5,Ettore Scola shows with delicacy and tact a situation so distant in the times but so current. Two characters who live situations of hardship and difficulty in a fascist Rome that sees a strong patriarchy and that affects both. A perfect interpretation of Marcello Mastroianni and a really modern theme. Spectacular direction and shots by Ettore Scola.
A Special Day,3,The acting is great but I expected a bit more from it.
A Special Day,5,A masterpiece of Italian cinema! Not to be missed Performances by both stars.
A Special Day,3.5,"Watched it recently on TCM... The opening sequences of B&W original footage are chilling, given that we know what happens... The rest of the movie is less interesting... I kept trying to give advice the protagonists, but they didn't listen!  Very slow plot... you have to have time to spare and a high tolerance boring dialogue.  Strange, but effective, coloration... not quite B&W, but it fits the narrative and the time."
A Special Day,5,"No, this is not an action film; how could you think it might be?  Thanks to superb acting, the characters dominate the movie's valuation, but the cinematography is breathtaking.  It reminded me of Orwell's 1984 (book) because of its laconic dialog and propaganda running like basso continuo under the ... ""action""; there's no other way to say it.  So that is this faggot's impression of an historic (1977) film."
A Special Day,5,"If I could, I'd give it seven stars."
A Special Day,3,"Despite being both in tragic situations, they still find something beautiful to share."
A Special Day,4,"6 çocuklu mussolini a???? bir anne (sophia loren) ve kar?? pencerede oturan gay bir spikerin (mastroianni) bir günlük hikayesini anlat?yor. hitler in roma ya geldi?i gün ailenin ve bütün halk?n kutlamalara gitmesiyle sadece bu ikili ve kap?c? kal?or ortada. en sonunda kad?n adama a??k oluor adeta ve sevi?iolar, filmin sonunda 2 ki?i geliyor ve adam? sürgüne gönderiolar..."
A Special Day,5,"Previously I had seen many pairings of Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni--next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, this is my favourite cinematic coupling--but never any works by director Scola, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, especially with it being a period piece of Italy just before the Second World War. This was a masterpiece. I could talk all day about how excellent the two stars must have been, in order to completely subvert every preconception we have come to associate with their on-screen romantic partnership (namely, Loren portraying a shy, put-upon mother of six, and Mastroianni playing a suicidal gay man) AND so convincingly. As well, I heartily recommend viewers to watch all of the extras on The Criterion Collection's recent release--I loved Scola's statement (and I paraphrase): 'Humour is as much a part of life as everything else--If a writer has a chance to put a comedic incident in a realistic drama, he has a moral obligation to do so.' I will remember that--and hopefully utilize it in my own work, should I ever be so gifted as to work in the field that I love--for the rest of my days."
A Special Day,3,"Slow and tedious in places, it's actually a very thoughtful piece of cinema if you can stick with it."
A Star Is Born,3.5,"Vicki Lester a grande estrela! No começo o filme traz a atriz na busca do estrelato, passando por várias dificuldades, sofrendo até da descrença da própria família."
A Star Is Born,4.5,"I believe this as one of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. I enjoyed the story, the dialog and above all I enjoyed the atmosphere and the actors. All of them are great but to me Fredric March is outstanding."
A Star Is Born,5,Destruction of a starlet.
A Star Is Born,4.5,"For some reason I went into this expecting it to be the worst of the multiple versions of this movie, but now that I'm reviewing it having seen all of them I think this was arguably the best of the lot. They certainly didn't take a movie that wasted a potentially good premise; this deserved the Oscar nominations it received and then some. They handled the color cinematography extremely well, the acting was top notch and they did the confrontation between Norman and the publicity guy better here than in any of the other versions. While I do like musical movies, I'm not nearly as big a fan of music as an entertainment medium & thus I liked this iteration better than the others for focusing squarely on the actress. Each of the remakes did something special in their own right, and I can't fault them for taking a successful movie and remaking it since they at least waited a long time, but I really liked this one and remember it fondly even after watching the more modern versions. Woohoo!"
A Star Is Born,3.5,"You'd expect a movie made in and about 1930's Hollywood to be upbeat and positive, in an ""I made it and you can too!"" sort of way, but this original iteration of the much-remade premise is actually surpisingly unvarnished. Hollywood was presented as a bright light to which hopeful starlets from all across the country flew to for success, and it was only the personal affection of an established star that landed Gaynor's Esther a transformation into Vicki; it's a far cry from an Alger novel. As someone introduced to the story with the 2018 Lady Gaga/Bradley Cooper version, there are certainly some stark differences (particularly in the lack of music and the focus on the film industry), but the surprisingly potent decline and self-sacrifice of March's Norman Maine is still sharp. One of the little-praised highlights of the film is Robson as the Grandmother, who is less doting and doddering than she is worldly, clever, and fun; her interactions with Gaynor are wonderful. Drags through stretches and could have been tightened up, but a solid first version of the film that would inspire remakes across several generations. (3.5/5)"
A Star Is Born,3,"I loved seeing the woman who played Aunt Em (in the Wizard of Oz) in this, and I appreciated seeing Esther admire the Chinese Theater hand and footprints. I thought it was interesting how it started and ended with the screenplay pages."
A Star Is Born,5,"Saw for the first time, free online.  Now i understand why this movie is so iconic."
A Star Is Born,5,Such a unique and incredible film. It's so incredible to see the original version of A STAR IS BORN. Seeing this plot play out for the first time feels truly legendary and historical. A must see. 
A Star Is Born,4,"Still the best version of the story, with incredible performances."
A Star Is Born,5,The absolute best version! And it's because of Frederic March!
A Trip to the Moon,5,"It was very interesting to see for me that the iconic image (where the rocket sticks into the eye of the moon) just takes a few seconds, but there are tons of other interesting elements we see later on in following sci-fi movies. It was also very nice to see that a movie which is the first example of its kind, and consequently which is too old, is still entertaining. It displays the value of true cinema concretely."
A Trip to the Moon,0.5,This movie was incredibly BORING. Some may call this a fill but i would call this rubbish. There is no talking and the acting looks worse than my GCSE drama peice. DISSAPOINTING. The film was not even interesting as the storyline was so unrealistic.
A Trip to the Moon,4,"The best remembered film of Georges Méliès, this film was such a success upon its early release that it was one of the first films to be bootlegged*. Based loosely on Jules Vernes' From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon."
A Trip to the Moon,3.5,"The movie itself wasn't particularly enjoyable. I didn't feel so much things. The story is good, the vfx are surprisingly efficient and perfect, the ensemble did a great job waving their arms everywhere. But at the end, what was fascinating was to see how people in 1902 imagined the world and the moon. How they thought it will be to send a spaceship on the Moon, how it would be and what they would get from that. The fact that we can now see how these people could think and wonder about the universe and compare it to our discoveries is a big privilege that I was happy to see."
A Trip to the Moon,5,"Feel the beginning of Cinema. the little pure motives that their low height ceilings made the foundation to the tallest skyscrapers. I wish I could hear the dialogues between them. all the decoration and Mise-en-scène was way ahead of the time, like I could never imagine what the people at that times could feel. the cuts and timings blow minds. this is a masterpiece because of its importance, because it was such a great turning point in history and because the meaning it wants to reflect. traveling to the moon, it's quite reasonable. but hurting the moon's right eye, it gets you in trouble! thanks to the black and white world of cinema."
A Trip to the Moon,3.5,"Silly by today's standards, but an absolute game-changer in its time, A Trip To The Moon is a damn weird film. A journey into space by what looks like Hogwarts Professors, travelling in a canon-propelled projectile, landing on the surface of the moon, which looks like a jungle, and being set upon by, of all things, people in bird costumes. It looks like what the explorers from King Kong would have discovered, not astronauts. But it's pointless to bash it, since filmmaking was so new and primitive back then that the camera is entirely static, and some performers can actually be seen hiding at the edges of the frame, waiting for their cue to emerge. It's quality may be questionable, but its impact and place in cinema history most certainly isn't."
A Walk in the Sun,4.5,"A film ahead of it's time, with an emphasis on individuals and their emotions, fears, resilience, and humanity.  Realistic, well-written, directed, and especially acted by a particularly talented cast.  War at it's most basic and traumatic, yet it's superior viewing as you absorb the heart and grit."
A Walk in the Sun,2.5,Wasn't my cup of tea and the California filming distracted. Very gutsy endeavor though.
A Walk in the Sun,4.5,One of the best WWII films.
A Walk in the Sun,2,"I have to say that I found this film a bit boring. I know it's supposed to be pondering its own navel, and introspective, etc. but even the dialogue was boring. The action scenes were quite good but not good enough to save this film."
A Walk in the Sun,3,Doesn't hold up as a realistic war movie after all this time
A Walk in the Sun,3,You can tell it was adapted from a book...  not a bad war film though
A Walk in the Sun,5,I don't want a purple heart in the head.
A Walk in the Sun,4,another WWII pic for WWII audiences
A Walk in the Sun,4,"Solid war film that explores the human elements of war versus battlefield action and heroics more often seen during this period of war films. Lewis Milestone directs the film that features far more conversations between solders in trenches and solders marching than it does pitched battle scenes. Robert Rossen wrote the smart script and the film features a strong cast that includes Dana Andrews, Richard Conte, John Ireland, Lloyd Bridges, Huntz Hall and the original voice of Winnie the Pooh, Sterling Holloway."
A Walk in the Sun,3,"This is one of the best and most interesting WWII movies ever made. I had not seen it since I was a teenager in the early 1960s, yet the title has staid with me ever since. The juxtaposition of killing and dying with the simple title works better than the Audy Murphy ""To Hell and Back"" autobiographical film. The mix-ups (getting separated on landing on the beach), the human frailties (the sergeant having a nervous breakdown after having to take command), the tough-talking New York cabbie-machine gunner who did not qualify as a machine gunner but bribed someone to land the job, John Ireland's character writing a letter in his head to his sister back home, . . . you feel as though you know/knew these people and were there with them in Italy 65 years ago. I had forgotten that the film was directed by Lewis Milestone, who also directed the 1930 film version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" The only flaw that I noticed this time is a slight one. The pacing of the film is intentionally slow, leading up to the violent combat at the end. However, in achieving this cinematic effect, Milestone seemingly has some events take place over a much longer period of time that they would have in ""real life"" (e.g., the landing craft seem to take forever to reach shore). All in all, this is a terrific movie. I own very few movies; I'm glad I own this one.  3 Stars   1-15-13"
A Woman's Face,5,"Joan rarely gets out of herself to act this well, not to mention allowing herself to be physically ""ugly."" Queer master director of women's films, George Cuckor, told her he didn't want to see her fall back on any of her old screen tricks, and under his sure and steady hand Joan delivers probably her strongest performance as a bonafide actress (as opposed to iconic movie star)."
A Woman's Face,5,By far one of Joan's best Dramatic Performances throughout her MGM Career you will not be disappointed as Joan Crawford is the unhinged yet Beautifully Disfigured Blackmailer
A Woman's Face,4,"Hardly recognized JOAN CRAWFORD, she looked good (did someone pluck her EYEBROWS?), but it was 1942 or so.  & MELVIN DOUGLAS as the plastic surgeon. Lots of good reviews. Features some awesome oments. & a high speed horse-drawn sleigh chase, someahat reminiscent of the CHARIOT race in BEN HUR.  I'm afraid I got confused and didn't follow the plot well, should watch it again someday, or read a plot summary.  I never heard of or saw until TV 12.3.2020.  PS:  OLGA MASSEN was particularly hot & sexy as the Doc's wife."
A Woman's Face,5,"Joan Crawford stars as Anna Holm, a sometimes angry woman who has an ugly scar on her face,as now she is in court for being part of a plot to kidnap a child."
A Woman's Face,4,"Spectacular!!! This is just the type of film one expects from the master director George Cukor. An all star cast, fantastic sets and, most of all, an absolutely gripping plot of mystery, bitterness, intrigue, redemption and love - ""A Woman's Face"" has it all! Crawford shines. And then she's ably supported by the solid Melvyn Douglas, the sinister Conrad Veidt and a great supporting cast that really make this such a compelling film. Also, what I would assume was staying true to the original source material, the production being set in Sweden just made it that much more interesting.  Catch this classic when you can!!!"
A Woman's Face,3.5,Classic film in which a facial operation and love change a woman's life forever. Some the the great Hollywood character actors make this soap opera plot a good watch.
A Woman's Face,4.5,Joan Crawford is excellent in this dark elegant melodrama.
A Woman's Face,3,Anna (Joan Crawford) is a physically scarred woman who blackmail's known cheaters for the purpose of money.  She bonds with Torsten Barring (Conrad Veidt) who is a manipulator.
A Woman's Face,5,It was one of the best movies I have ever watched mostly because the queen of hollywood Joan Crawford was the star
A Woman's Face,3.5,A different murder courtroom drama based in Holland.
Aelita: Queen of Mars,4,"Aelita is definitely not 'Metropolis' as it is not a serious science fiction film, but more a fantastical one and a pretty good early genre effort. The dramatic elements are overwhelming, but the sci-fi is pretty memorable as is the romance. The highlights are its striking imagery, highly memorable costumes and solid atmosphere and world building."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,3,"This Soviet-era USSR silent movie is a drama with early science-fiction elements (featuring Martians in constructivist outfits beginning, of course, a communist revolution) and, surprisingly, a lot of dialogue."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,3.5,"Science fiction about a trip to Mars from the glorious Soviet Socialists Republics wherein a science noodler with marriage problems longs for a better life abroad ... way, way abroad.  Despite being released in 1929 everything has stood the test of time very well.  The acting is as naturalistic as anything modern even if the style is dated, and the look and feel of the advanced civilisation on Mars ain't too far from the best of Art Deco.  And yes, silent.  But that means yer lazy imagination has to get up and, uh, imagine for a change.  Worth a look."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,3.5,es interesante...aunque hay partes en que se vuelve confusa
Aelita: Queen of Mars,4,"A revolução soviética chega a Marte, graças a um cientista que desiste de viver na Terra após descobrir que sua mulher estava lhe traindo. Um dos primeiros filmes de ficção científica, mas já tem conflitos interessantes, bem trabalhados. Destaque para as portas automáticas, os telescópios marcianos, os cenários triangulares, e as roupas, aaahhh as roupas dos marcianos são demais!"
Aelita: Queen of Mars,3,"That Russo-Martian commie woman, Aelita, has one of the finest and meanest unibrows of the day."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,2,The martian scenes are beautiful but otherwise the movie lacks focus and the soviet propaganda really doesn't find it's place here.
Aelita: Queen of Mars,4,"This is the first Russian movie I've actually really liked.  It has such cool sets, costumes, and cinematography to go along with it's story!  The story is overall about Russian astronauts who are planning a trip to Mars after receiving a strange message from them.  Mars is also looking down on Earth, watching them, and the queen has fallen in love with the astronaut.  Then there are also some kinda dull scenes about the Russian people, which I don't think the movie needed, but they didn't distract too much.  If you're interested in early sci-fi movies please don't hesitate to see this one."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,2.5,"I fell asleep for a good half hour in the middle, so I don't really know what went on. Definite propaganda, though."
Aelita: Queen of Mars,5,"When I went to see this silent gem, I thought I knew what I was getting. The story is quite different from the more genre-faithful sci-fi novel by Alexey Tolstoy, and in any other context, the addition of an ""unnecessary"" relationship drama and dream framework would be a horrible travesty of the original. But in this case, the focus on ordinary life and intrigue in early ""New Economic Policy"" Moscow brings added value to a history enthusiast. The material poverty, pure misery, fanatical enthusiasm and novelty craze of the early 1920's is raw and touching. The costumes and sets in earthly Soviet Russia and futuristic Mars provide an appealing visual contrast. But the crowning glory was the live music accompaniment by Cleaning Women. More than just a melodic score, their unique sound defined the mood mingling industrial noises and vaguely oriental tunes in the minor key. All in all, this is a movie for connoisseurs - if your knowledge of the early years of the Soviet Union and Russian culture in general is limited, and if you don't have the opportunity to watch the film as it was intended, on the silver screen with live music and a lively audience, you may miss a lot of the fun."
Afghan Star,4.5,"Much more than ""American Idol in Afghanistan,"" Afghan Star captures a moment in Afghan history when music speaks directly to power, fraternity transcends ethnicity, and a woman's televised dancing is an act of defiance."
Afghan Star,5,"seperti yang dkatakan salah satu anak kecil di awal cerita, musik bukan melulu tentang keindahan suara saja, karena bagaimanapun dunia tanpa suara (dalam hal ini musik tentu saja) menjadi begitu mencekam. yang ada hanya kesunyan."
Afghan Star,0.5,"There is no reason that anyone who saw this would give it a good rating. It is absolute pandering garbage, not to mention being poorly done and resulting in the death of some of it's actors. The fact that critics have given this positive reviews should bring to question their credentials."
Afghan Star,4,"Afghan Star takes an original viewpoint in portraying the contrasts in culture. With her film, in fact, Havana Marking shows the various social and political implications that come with a TV format that on the Western side of the boarder is regarded as tasteless and commercialised which it has on a violence and poverty ridden society like Afghanistan. Insightful and intriguing all throughout, this documentary also works as a piece of upbeat entertainment."
Afghan Star,3.5,funny and sad in the same time
Afghan Star,5,"Excellent, informative, culturally eye-opening, moving and beautifully put together, this is what the documentary genre was created for."
Afghan Star,3.5,"Very interesting film. You are, at first saddened by the fact that these so-called tallent compentitions that are ruining the music industry across the globe has even reached Afghanistan but then lifted by the fact that it is some light relief for a troubled nation but then bought back down to earth with a bump when you see the reactions of some people/groups. I just hope that Simon Cowell isn't making any money out of this."
Afghan Star,3.5,"A very interesting documentary about reality TV (singing competition) in Afghanistan after the Taliban was removed from power.  Lots of them wanted to sing too.  And of course, win the coveted the title of being the Afghan star."
Afghan Star,4,"Far better than the original American or Pop Idol, Afghan Star depicts people erupting after having their collective expressions put under the boot of the Taliban. The idols are unique and terribly fun to watch."
Afghan Star,4,"An enlightening and sobering documentary on Afghanistan's very own ""American Idol."""
After the Thin Man,5,Perhaps even funnier than the first Thin Man film!
After the Thin Man,4.5,"The first ""Thin Man"" was great, but I like ""After the Thin Man"" even better. William Powell and Myrna Loy, as Nick and Nora Charles, are the archetype sophisticated couple. No one since has come close. Great casting of the supporting roles fills out the story exquisitely. Wow, could those old studios serve up wonderful acting for all kinds of characters! My favorite is Aunt Katherine, the battle ax to end all battles axes, played by Jessie Ralph; and Henry, the rickety old butler played by, would you believe, Tom Ricketts."
After the Thin Man,4,"The original ""The Thin Man"" movie was based on the title Dashiell Hammett detective novel, and it played itself more for its humorous aspects than as a serious mystery. The idea evidently worked, for this started a series of ""Thin Man"" movies which were not based on any Hammett stories, with the comic adventures of Nick and Nora doing detective work."
After the Thin Man,4,I think I liked this one better than the first one.
After the Thin Man,3.5,I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first but it was still hilarious. Loved Asta and his canine companions
After the Thin Man,4.5,
After the Thin Man,5,"Things move fast and furiously because we have already been introduced to Powell and Loy.  A little known Jimmy Stewart is added to the cast and he becomes one of the focal points.  This still moves a little too fast for the average detective show, but the ending ties everything up.  Loy, Powell, Stewart, and Asta, as well as all the other actors do a remarkable job in this sequel to the popular ""Thin Man"".   There would be many other sequels, due to its great popularity  Myrna Loy is a very special actor, who could work with anyone and produce sizzling chemistry.  She did her best work with the charming William Powell.."
After the Thin Man,5,"Writers.. directors.. take a look.. outside the 30ï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s kitsch.. tight, no water plot points, clean.. exactly like a Dashiell Hammet novel.. get back to this .. PLEASE!"
After the Thin Man,5,"My favorite of the series.  The first might have been my first choice but their is less noise in the second; improvements in audio technology???  Also, there are scenes in the second film that are priceless:  returning home to a welcome back party, with guests who don't even know who Nick and Nora are....Nick trying to grab the phone from Nora as she accepts an invitation to visit Nora's aged relatives; and the New Year's Eve party with Nick and Nora's usual repartee....who could ask for more???"
After the Thin Man,4,"Very similar style to its predecessor (The Thin Man, 1934). More classic wit from William Powell. I think I still liked the first one better though."
Age of Consent,4,"Great acting, wonderful story, beautiful scenery, and you get to see Helen Mirren nude back when she was a hottie!"
Age of Consent,4.5,"I loved this film. The great James Mason has the worst Australian accent ever committed to celluloid (at one point it becomes South African), but it doesn't matter. The gorgeous locations on Australia's Barrier Reef, and the strange tone throughout - by turns farcical and tender - make this the stuff of cult cinema. There are echoes of Mason's Humbert Humbert in his relationship with a very young Helen Mirren, and a very funny turn by Jack McGowran as Mason's parasitic pal. Terrific."
Age of Consent,5,A look at a time gone by and age of innocence with beautiful scenery of the Queensland reef. Helen Mirren stunning.Very watchable
Age of Consent,1,"Reviewed 10.10.17.  Michael Powell directed one of my all-time favorite movies, Stairway to Heaven (A Matter of Life and Death). That movie is everything this movie is not. It was original, charming and romantic. Age of Consent is boring, distasteful and skeevy. I get that in 1969 a joke about a man being raped, or a grandpa aged leading man having a teenage love interest, was socially acceptable in some circles. And for entertainment's sake, that could be looked past, if the movie had anything else to offer. But the supporting roles are all horribly overacted caricatures. The plot is paper thin. The only interest is watching Helen Mirren in her first role. But even that wears thin as they apparently thought showing her breasts through a wet shirt in practically every scene was her greatest asset. Glad she proved them wrong over her distinguished career. All this movie proved is even talented directors can misfire, and that people could be particularly gross in 1969. Seems one star is the lowest rating, so let's say a 1/2 star each for the cute dog, and the appealing setting."
Age of Consent,3.5,"Director Michael Powell's final film follows on the heels of his previous Australian venture (They're a Weird Mob, 1966) moving from Sydney up to Brisbane and North Queensland. It stars James Mason (with tenuous accent) as an Australian painter who leaves New York to return to his roots on a remote tropical island near the Great Barrier Reef.  Although he's burnt out, the relaxed environment starts to bring back his creative streak.  A cheeky teenager (played by young Helen Mirren) soon becomes his muse; Mirren spends a lot of the movie in a state of undress as a result.  This is a bit jarring if you only know her from Prime Suspect and her late career superstardom (possibly Calendar Girls, 2006, which I haven't seen, brings things full circle).  Similarly to Weird Mob, there's a bit of comic relief here as well, poking fun at Aussie stereotypes and slang, when Mason's insufferable friend Nat Kelly (Jack MacGowran) comes to visit and gets into trouble.  But overall the tone is laid back, as if the gentle rhythm of the waves was setting the pace of the picture. Plenty of shots of the lush locations and underwater photography of the reef do not disappoint. Mason ultimately gets his mojo back, although the May-September romance that eventuates does have an ick factor. The paintings on display don't strike me as particularly notable but an early shot of a Sidney Nolan artbook suggests that Powell does have better taste.  It's a shame (after his masterworks with Pressburger) that his career ground completely to a halt after this, due to lack of funding, aged 64."
Age of Consent,3.5,"There are some nervous insertions of redundant comic relief, but not enough to shatter the prevailing mood: brilliant sunlight illuminating all the unmomentous ins and outs of a human passion."
Age of Consent,4,"Beautiful film, yound Helen Mirren had so much charm and innocence despite the nude scenes, she is very gorgeous, and the film itself is quite entertaining and nice to watch with wonderful shots of the nature and ocean."
Age of Consent,1.5,"I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to watch this for young naked Helen Mirren. In that regard, I was vastly rewarded. On its own as a film, it's pretty bland and boring. Mason's character isn't very interesting, and not much happens (besides said Mirren getting naked lots). I guess I could pretend to say I wanted to watch it because it's Michael Powell's last film since it's at least partially true, and I was also let down in that regard; what a whimper to go out on."
Age of Consent,1.5,"Ahhh The Things Men Get Up To While On Sabbaticals..Bit Dated, But Challenges Typical Misogynistic Views By Men (Of The 70s) Towards Women. The Aussie Rainforests Of The Tropics & Barrier Reef Is Beautiful, But Overall The Story Is Very Dry & Lacks Multifariousness."
Age of Consent,3,its worth a watch just to see a young Helen Mirren...and i actually thought the story of an artist looking for inspiration on an island was an interesting concept.  it's not quite the story i expected of him finding his model in this washed up island girl..but it was good to watch overall if a little slow and meandering..i have to say- my biggest complaint about this relatively mediocre island movie was the character of the girl's grandmother/Ma- she was just so badly written and one dimensional.  i get she was an alcoholic and severely delusional but why was she so overly protective and watchful of this every girl's moves?  It just didn't all add up for me...she seemed like a caricature of the paranoid religious mother who doesn't want to give up her virgin daughter to animalistic impure men...  also as funny as Jack MacGowran was to watch- the nat kelly subplot seemed really thrown in and didn't pose much threat or foreseeable element to the overall plot.  it was just a minor nuisance for the james mason character and so he was setback $300 bucks a few paintings and loses a supposed friend from the beginning. the script could've been a heck of alot better too- but i do like the visuals and particularly the piano music sequences are very pretty that reflect the romantic nature atmosphere on the island and art sessions.  and a NOTE about flixter site:  i'm really disliking the synopsis writers giving away blatant plot elements...sometimes the viewers would like to SEE the movie themselves instead of getting fed the plot in the synopsis before they even see it...
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4.5,"Masterwork from Fassbender with strong performances. Great sets and beautifully composed shots and editing as well as colour. Great screenplay highlighting racism but also the pragmatic/cynical reasons why people may move on. A heavy subject but it is also funny in places, entertaining and tight so it never drags. Sadly still relevant today. Good remastering available thanks to the Fassbender Institute. Don't let the subject put you off."
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4,"From a poster that overflows humanity and a long-suffering love, ""Ali Fear Eats Soul"" is phenomenal. Fassbinder's obsessive directing work is in stark contrast to the script, this sometimes skews the material. The film is unique. 8/10"
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4.5,"Absurd, moving, cringe, sweet, angry, funny. It's got a bit of everything. A weird but brilliant clash of cultures and generations with two amazing lead performances. More than anything it felt like an essay on loneliness of the elderly and the dislocated immigrant. Brilliantly made and worthy of its status as a classic of European cinema."
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4,"Fassbinder provides many insights into the harm done by stereotypes based on age, gender and nationality without being pedantic. Every interaction among Emmi, Ali and their acquaintances reveals a different angle in a highly-personalized way. It also shows how feelings evolve over time depending on circumstances. The pacing of the film also gives time for reflection as shots are help a bit longer than one would expect. After 47 years the film is still relevant and impactful."
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,5,A simple story both tender and brutal. There are times when it's a little rough round the edges but that only adds to the charm. Can't recommend this enough.
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4,"It seems this film is a fine example of Fassbinder's best work as part of the German New Wave cinema. Are most Germans such horrible, petty, envious and bigoted people? Are most people in general? Can they also see their errors, the uselessness and  basic destructive essence of such hate, bigotry, envy? "
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,1.5,Looks like a caricature.
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4.5,"Wow, already I'm entranced by the Arabian music in the opening titles. This is almost dream like. Wtf am I watching? This is amazing already. Very little has been said or implied but already I'm super interested. And where did Fassbinder find all these attractive woman? Seems like good ole Nazi racism is still well and alive in this movie. It's actually kind of sweet seeing them become closer to one another. Jesus, she's surrounded by all this fear, negativity and bigotry. It's almost like a nightmare or as if she's living on another planet. Holy shit! I was not expecting her mother to come through the door. I thought that the chick in the black dress was some sort of escort girl. Wow, the writing and storytelling is impeccable. "
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,5,"Emmi, a 60 year old widowed cleaner decides to enter a bar that is playing Arabic music to shield from the rain. She sits at a table on her own far from the regulars who are at the other side of the bar. They dare one of their entourage, Ali to go and ask her to dance. Whilst they think he will refuse instead he calls their bluff and complies."
Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,4.5,"In the hands of a lesser director or actors, Fear Eats the Soul could have become a hackneyed portrait of a mismatched couple in an environment that doesn't accept them. Instead, we see much more: half-measures and compromise in an effort at adaptation, and a love story that goes beyond its initial premise. (4.5/5)"
Alice in the Cities,5,"To see this film for the first time in 2022 is to be amazed - and somewhat saddened - at the changes that have happened since 1974. Alice in the Cities could not be made now because search engines and mobile phones would solve its quest problems too quickly and because a film about an adult male and child relationship would reek of suspicion. But it is a beautiful film and the central relationship is so natural and well observed. The intellectual angst of the young man is tempered by the child's innocent and visceral response to life. As their winding journey together unspools, we see the man thaw, and set aside some of his fury at the commercialization of the world, in order to take care of another small being. America's destructive powers are only just becoming clear in 1974 and the film is a horrible prefiguring of what capitalism has done to us since, but primarily it is a film about a relationship, and a mutually beneficial one. Wim Wenders was young when he made it but it is a very well crafted, subtle and life-affirming work. The last shot is masterful."
Alice in the Cities,4.5,"Alice in the Cities, the first installment of Wim Wenders' Road Trilogy, stars Rudiger Volger as a German journalist traveling across America in search of both a story and some sort of meaning to his life.  As he prepares to return to Europe, he is burdened with the responsibility of caring for a nine-year-old girl (Yella Rottlander) who has been abandoned by her mother on the eve of their return to Europe.  Filled with a myriad of thought-provoking themes and some beautiful, albeit grainy, camerawork, the primary reason for watching Alice in the Cities is the stunning performance of Rottlander as Alice, a character imbued with remarkable depth thanks to the young actress' phenomenal skills."
Alice in the Cities,4,"A good examination of the modern world through the lens of a forced relationships between a German photojournalist in his middle life crisis and a little girl whose mother abandoned her, with a moody soundtrack and documentary style photography."
Alice in the Cities,3.5,me parece maravillosa la forma que tiene Wim Wenders de concluir sus historias
Alice in the Cities,5,manages to be a psychological study and yet not to be to heavy. Fun yet introspective.
Alice in the Cities,4,"What's most remarkable about Alice in the Cities is the way it so vividly--even in grainy 16mm black & white--captures the mid 1970s. Wim Wenders borrows more from French New Wave than his more aggressively rule-demolishing (or at least redefining) contemporaries in New German Cinema by taking the camera to the streets and rendering a relatively simple story in a way that is transcendent. It's a slow, meandering film full of long takes of urban streets and life, and even 40 years later the filmmaking is powerful enough to feel incredibly fresh. "
Alice in the Cities,4,"8.0/10, my review: http://wp.me/p1eXom-2xg"
Alice in the Cities,3.5,"A very watchable road movie with great cinematography (contrasting the US and Germany) and interesting characters. It doesn't reach high, but succeeds in telling a good tale."
Alice in the Cities,2,The symbolism did not appeal.
Alice in the Cities,4.5,"An early Wim Wenders that began his penchant for picturesque cinematography, international flavor, and earnest storytelling. Starring Wenders himself as the film's curious protagonist, the film almost acts as his travelogue, documenting sights in both America and Europe, while also telling a whimsical (albeit simple) story. The film will often go long stretches of scenery chewing, but it's fine as it works as a meditation, and the dialogue is rich enough to bring us back into the narrative when appropriate. Probably the defining film for the German filmmaker's early years."
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,3,"It's not as good at the movie it's a sequel to, but it is an excellent continuation, with a retcon for the ages!"
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,4,Left me hanging. Want more of the story.
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,2.5,"Lot's of incredible designs, costumes, concepts, etc. Unfortunately, the A-story is not all that compelling. Watchable, but does not deliver what fans had been hoping for over the long 5 year wait since the original."
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,4,"I liked the expanding of the world of The Devil's Carnival, and I liked the portrayal of Heaven as being like golden age Hollywood (pretty from a distance, but tainted when you look closer), but overall I think Devil's Carnival worked better as a short rather than a feature.  It kind of starts to overstay its welcome, and Heaven isn't as much fun as Hell was (also Hell had better songs).  Still, if you're a fan of Devil's Carnival, you'll probably enjoy this entry since it has a lot more of what you love.  The sets are gorgeous making full use of their miniscule budget, the performances are great, the songs are catchy, and the themes are interesting.  The extended runtime does also manage to give more time for character development, so it ends up being a bit deeper in that regard than the original.  Overall I definitely like the first one more, but this is still a welcome entry in the saga.  And with that painful cliffhanger ending, I can't wait to see what comes next."
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,3,"""Always Alleluia"""
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,3.5,"I guess this is the second act of Bousman and Zdunich's Hell vs Heaven trilogy. This film is much stronger than the first, although I am gouging my final score for it because it absolutely has an unsatisfactory ending."
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,4.5,Great prequel to Painted Doll
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,5,"My new favorite movie. Every detail contributes beautifully to the whole to build a complete, well thought-out world. I really have nothing but praise. Alleluia!"
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,5,"This movie was truly spectacular.  While expectations are generally that you've seen Repo the Genetic Opera or the first episode of The Devil's Carnival, this movie is for fans of horror, musicals, and all things weird!  Think along the lines of Rocky Horror."
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival,5,"A brilliant continuation of the first movie; Terrance did an amazing job giving both a backstory/prequel to what we were given the first time, AND a thrilling, if unexpected, sequel. The plots, acting, costumes, and especially the music and lyrics- are surprisingly daring. "
10 Minutes Gone,0.5,10 minutes gone? More like an hour and a half gone. Absolute waste of time.
10 Minutes Gone,2,"A pre-planned bank robbery doesn't go accordingly, so Frank (Michael Chiklis) attempts to retract what happened by visiting each member of the group.   Bruce Willis also stars as Res the bank heist group is supposedly working for until one of them double crossed them."
10 Minutes Gone,1,"Within the opening minutes you know, yes you really know this is going to be rubbish. The directing and  busy busy use of camera movement is ridiculous. What we're the director and Bruce Willis trying to do pay homage to the poorest of B movies. You just want to put the camera where the sun don't shine. Poor everything."
10 Minutes Gone,4,"Filmes com assalto a bancos/cofres sempre me atraem, quando tudo dá errado melhor ainda, com muitas perseguições e alguma revolta se torna mais adorável, nada novo, mas entretêm, Bruce Willis ganhando dinheiro fácil, só paradim num escritório, nem põe a mão na massa... O filme parece um jogo de resta 1, abate atrás de abate, mas o plot twist estava meio previsível né, quem não suspeitou do grande traidor, só o protagonista…"
10 Minutes Gone,1,TERRIBLE.... it started out slow but then it slowed down even more
10 Minutes Gone,2,"86 minutes, gone."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,5,"Fantastic movie, by far better than Titanic and The Godfather! I recommend this movie to anyone, plus I'm the newest reviewer of this movie since 2009!!"
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,5,Funny and original!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Thousand Words,2,"Not as bad as what other critics say, but just barely passes as watchable with rare bold message of the importance of words...."
A Thousand Words,2.5,i got 7 words for this movie unfunny its not a bad movie but its a bad movie by the end of the day its pretty bland nothing that good about it wired but its not bad but bad.why is eddie in a lot of bad stuff?
A Thousand Words,3,"Funny, rather predictable, but could have been much funnier. I guess it's hard to be funny when a really unlikeable character isn't redeemed until the very last minute.  Growing up watching Eddie Murphy this was a movie I somehow missed, so it was nice seeing the old Eddie on film again, but it's the shame the script didn't have more laughs. Bowfinger would be a much better film of his to watch."
A Thousand Words,5,I thought the movie had a beautiful intent with what the lesson in the movie was about
A Thousand Words,5,Don't know what all the negative reviews are about. This is one if the greatest movies of all time.
A Thousand Words,0.5,"Not Eddie Murphy's best but certainly not his worst. It has a aggravating plot, confusing humor and lack of a good script. Murphy can do much much better than this film."
A Thousand Words,5,"I really loved the story and philosophy behind this one. It was enjoyable, funny, gave me some stuff to think about, and it was worth the time to check out. "
A Thousand Words,5,This movie was interesting to say the least. It had comedy and a heart warming moral to the story to listen before one speaks.
A Thousand Words,2.5,"This is one of those feel-good-yet-sad movies that you know the ending of early on, and just watch to see if you've guessed correctly or not. It reminded me a lot of the movie Liar Liar."
A Thousand Words,5,"i like it very much, i hate everyone that hates this movie"
Acts of Violence,2.5,This was better than expected and I wasn't disappointed by it.  That may not be a good indicator of it's quality or lack thereof but it is what it is.
Acts of Violence,2.5,The potential for this movie and its stellar cast is what makes the reality so disappointing! The basic plot and pretty terrible writing can't even be rescued be Bruce. By all means put this on in the background while doing something that requires your attention.
Acts of Violence,1,"Cole Hauser and Bruce Willis are two of my favorites, but they just couldn't get this flick out of its grave.  Mike Epps does not belong as a criminal mastermind.  There isn't anything good to say about this movie.  The story is bad, shot without drama, music was not endearing to the scene, and there was no effort in the acting.  Don't watch this movie, save the time for something more worth while."
Acts of Violence,1.5,I used to think that anything with Bruce Willis was worth watching.
Acts of Violence,1,To have characters be former Army Rangers with combat experience and then have them employing absolute rookie weapons handling techniques is disgraceful. Also saw Bruce Willis providing cover while the brothers got into the van with his slide locked to the rear after he showed up on scene as a get away driver and didn't even fire a weapon shows lack of attention to detail when making the film.
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,4,Very atmospheric and entertaining.
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,1,Can't wait for it to be over.
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,3,"Man, this was fun!!!"
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,0.5,"Adrenlin: Fear The Rush is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. Though relatively short, the film is horribly boring and consists mainly of the characters running around screaming and shooting walls and doors because apparently cops in the future have terrible aim at all times. Despite having a plot with some vaguely interesting ideas, the film never expands on these ideas and instead becomes a really bad chase film in which nothing interesting ever happens. This doesn't work as a thriller, a sci-fi film, an action film, or even a guilty pleasure. It just sucks horribly and you should avoid it."
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,2,Adrenalin? There was hardly any jolt.
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,4,"85%"
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,4.5,One of the scariest movies I have ever seen. This low budget gem makes me wonder if anything is lurking in my basement. 2 thumbs up
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,1,It's bad but the whole monsters-lurking-in-the-shadows feel is decent.
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,5,"This movie is actually so bad that it is awesome.  My friends and I were thinking that once the initial chase scene was over, maybe they could develop the plot or something.  Guess what: the chase is the whole movie.  That takes balls."
Adrenalin: Fear the Rush,1,"So this is a pretty big waste of time. There is no story to speak of, the action is drab. The movie gets a plus for: "
Affair in Trinidad,4,"Perhaps Hayworth's best performance. Great spy noir, although Ford duller than usual. Moore is adorable as the wise and helpful Trinidadian."
Affair in Trinidad,2,"Glenn Ford plays one of his most unlikeable characters. Rita Hayworth is ho-hum. And, the film's (maybe) villain, Alexander Scourby, is unsurprising.  Unlikeable, ho-hum and unsurprising. That about describes the entire picture."
Affair in Trinidad,3,"seen on THE MOVIE CHANNEL a cuple times.  interesting.  RITA, GLENN, & ALEXANDER SCOURBY! WW2 ESPIONAGE is the spoiler"
Affair in Trinidad,4,Affair in Trinidad is an awesome film. It is about a nightclub singer and her brother-in-law who try to find her husband's killer. Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford give fantastic performances. The screenplay is good but a little slow in places. Vincent Sherman did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama. Affair in Trinidad is a must see.
Affair in Trinidad,4.5,got to love that dress and dance!
Affair in Trinidad,3,Enjoyable 50's noir-flavoured thriller/romance--Rita makes a hot spy!!
Affair in Trinidad,3.5,"thou not as good as GILDA, but still it's good to see Glenn Ford & Rita in one movie again, yet it's quite entertaining and enjoyable movie :)"
Affair in Trinidad,3.5,"An implausible Cold War film (transitioning between the Second World War and the Cold War, spreading the lie that the Soviet Union rather than the U.S. inherited the legacy of Nazi Germany) that sort of anticipates the Cuban Missile Crisis.  And why does Glenn Ford (always) have such a chip on his shoulders?  Is it because he's a Canadian pretending to be American?  He surely deserved to suffer a beat-down here for the way he treats Rita Hayworth."
Affair in Trinidad,3,"Not Just [i]Gilda[/i] in the Tropics  "
Affair in Trinidad,3,"I know it's just a pale shadow of Gilda, but Affair in Trinidad is an enjoyable thriller nonetheless. Rita Hayworth pretty much defines the term 'movie star' for me. She was so beautiful and a dream of a dancer. There was also a sadness and mystery about her. Whereas in Gilda, Glenn Ford was a great foil for Rita, here he's simply dull. Much better are Juanita Moore and Valerie Bettis in supporting roles."
Air Strike,1,Horrible in every imaginable way.
Air Strike,3,"Special effects are mediocre at best.  The plot is an interesting take on possible events that were unlikely in WWII. The scriptwriting was a bit amateur.  Overall, the movie is well below Bruce Willis. All that said, if you like anime, you will probably like this movie. It very much seems like a live-action version of an anime."
Air Strike,1.5,"I had high hopes for this movie since I really like Bruce Willis and world war 2 movies.  But this was bad.  From the completely fake looking planes and explosions (unless that was the goal) to the crazy unrealistic ""physics"" of moving objects etc. The last action scene with the plane landing on the truck had me in stitches; sooo unrealistic and stupid. Can't believe Bruce Willis would be in a movie of this caliber. And Adrian Brody? He had like 5 lines yet he's listed as having a major role?  It was more like a 2 minute cameo.  Geeeez"
Air Strike,0.5,"I am in my 60s and have been a student of cinema forever. Sometimes I watch bad movies with the morbid fascination of watching a car accident. This one qualifies: it is overly melodramatic, has bad dubbing (non-English speakers uttering unatural phrases; like Foreign B movies of the 60s), overacting, long scenes that add no obvious value. It seems like every other scene is designed to get a big 'awwww' from the audience. It just made me feel cynical and sarcastic. As though someone went to Spielberg school and came away with only the most saccharin, schmaltzy elements. I don't mind in the least that Bruce Willis got paid enough to do this. Every actor, especially after a long successful career can make a number of bad flicks and it doesn't destroy their career. I would have given it 0 stars, but didn't want anyone to think I had merely forgotten to rate it."
Air Strike,1,The movie plot was so confusing. Would not recommend.
Air Strike,1,I couldn't even finish it. It looked like something a propaganda ministry would put together. The CGI planes looked like something out of a decent video game. The over the top clichés were everywhere like putting an entire salt shaker into your bowl of soup. Intolerable.
Air Strike,1,This was a monumental piece of crap. I am shocked that Bruce Willis agreed to do this did.
Air Strike,3.5,"I haven't seen a WWII movie that showed the war from the Chinese perspective, so that was interesting in itself. And as a reminder, they were US allies back then. I'm glad that some well known American actors signed on. I'm sure they did it to help a budding director - that is actually why I decided to watch it. The movie was entirely dubbed in English, but that was better than reading subtitles. Bottomline, not as bad as the reviews would leave you to believe. I enjoyed it."
Air Strike,0.5,Poor visual effects. I thought China has money but even those cheap Japanese godzilla films of the 50s had better effects. Poor acting. I guess they needed a couple of big Hollywood names to attract some saps to watch this rubbish. Maybe all the money went to convincing Bruce Willis to join the cast because it certainly didn't go into the local actors or visual effects.
Air Strike,0.5,"Are you kidding me?  This isn't a movie, it's a train wreck!  AVOID!"
An Invisible Sign,4.5,"This movie should've had a sequel and had much better ratings. Such an good movie and the cast has really good chemistry. I honestly don't know why this movie received not great reviews. I think I would've liked to see more scenes exploring the relationship blooming between the two teachers but other than that, 10/10 loved it. Forever in my top 10 movies."
An Invisible Sign,4,A hidden issue brought to the screen with sensitivity. Jessica Alba gave a most compelling performance.
An Invisible Sign,4.5,Stupid people. Who don't know anything about movies.
An Invisible Sign,0.5,Literally terrible. 
An Invisible Sign,1,Watched this film and I actually think i need bleach for my eye's. Disgusting and unironicly rotten
An Invisible Sign,2,"Jessica Alba stars in the bland, lighthearted indie comedy An Invisible Sign.  The story follows a socially dysfunctional young woman who takes a job as an elementary school teacher, but has trouble connecting with her students.  The film lives and dies on Alba's performance, and unfortunately she's not very good.  It's hard to get a handle on her character, and whether she has a mental disorder or is just incredibly socially awkward.  And there are a number of issues with the plot.  Yet, An Invisible Sign is mildly entertaining and has some charming moments."
An Invisible Sign,0.5,"UGH. Awful, awful film. A woman-child with an unstated mental disorder who does not really understand (or preform) actual math, somehow got a teaching job and has trouble functioning. I like Ms. Alba, but her acting in this stinker is absolutely horrendous, while the story is utter rubbish. SKIP it."
An Invisible Sign,3,"At first I felt that An Invisible Sign was a romantic comedy/drama, then for a few minutes it started to feel more like a psychological thriller, before it then went back to being a reguar romantic drama again. "
An Invisible Sign,0.5,The only thing that matches the name of the movie is that you Could not catch any anything from this movie.
An Invisible Sign,5,This is a heart warming tale.  Jessica Alba isn't just sexy.  This is top notch acting in a tear jerker movie.  She also narrates the movie.  Jessica does have a sexy voice.
Arthur and the Great Adventure,2.5,Eu gostaria de dizer que achei meh
Arthur and the Great Adventure,5,Love all the Arthur movies!
Arthur and the Great Adventure,5,"Bom demais, o roteiro é impressionante e as cenas de ação são de arrepiar. Essa obra francesa esta no mesmo nivel de Toy Story e outros filmes de animação."
Arthur and the Great Adventure,3.5,"Not as good as the previous installment, but still a fun plot for all the family. The recasting of Malthazard is a disappointment as he is not as menacing as when he was voiced by David Bowie"
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,1.5,"I didn't even know there was a third part before starting watching.  Based on my disappoint of the first two I wasn't exactly looking forward to this.  Holy ****, they recast again!?!"
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,0.5,"Not worthy of half a star, a mindless piece of junk in every way, shape and form."
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,0.5,"Absolutely terrible.  They have once again recast every single character, after recasting everyone in the 2nd movie.  Dagni is suddenly 10-15 years younger and John Gault is 10 years younger and suddenly we go from a drama/suspense movie to a weird and very poorly written hallmark romance drivel.  The entire basis for the whole story makes absolutely no sense.  <<<spoilers>>> John Gault and the ""best and brightest"" have been disappearing from the world because they're 'on strike', except no one knows because its super secret.  What is the point of going on strike if you don't tell anyone that you are and why?????????"
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,3,i thought the book was amazing def go check it out. The movie was eh but as a huge atlas shrugged fan i thought it was good. But i think the main problem with this was trying to fit a 60 hour book to 1-3 hour movie. I think the goal of this movie was to make you imagine what was happing of camera like using you imagination in a book. 
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,1,"Even worse than its two preceding films, the obviously cheap CG, staging, and complete recast confirm the film's budget was paper thin. Before digging into the bad aspects, I must admit that for films typically in this budget range, the quality of the acting could have been much worse."
Atlas Shrugged: Who Is John Galt?,5,If 'critics' say it is bad I really want to watch it.
Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!! A cinematic masterpiece that deserves a spot next to Lord of the Rings and other classics. A must-watch for anyone.
Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,0.5,if i could give 0 i would
Bedeviled,0.5,"Wanna watch a horrible movie with clowns as the monsters?  Ever since I was a kid, I had an unnatural fear of clowns.  Not knowing there were clowns in this movie, I never should have watched it, but then again, I also get great satisfaction by saying ""Phew, this movie stinks to high Heavan, thus my 1/2 star review."
Bedeviled,0.5,"This atrocity was more annoying than painful to sit through, and that wouldn't even be such a bad thing if it wasn't such a CHEAP looking film overall, as well as BORING."
Bedeviled,3.5,I thought it was pretty good. It's worth giving it a chance.
Bedeviled,5,"No one survived, except the blonde female. I thought the guy was going to survive as well. He almost did survive. Too bad the monster killed him. (They shouldn't downloaded the app) If they wouldn't downloaded it, they would still be alive."
Bedeviled,2,"If Pennywise acted through an app. The effects were pretty good for this small a movie, but outside of that there wasn't a lot to write home about. Some bad acting and writing in this that really take away feom some admittedly seriously scary visuals. Filled my quota for 'bad horror film' for the night, though."
Bedeviled,0.5,"Absolutely brillitantly, shocking. Worst acting i have seen since coronarion street first aired and the worst make up effects since debenhams started offering make up services. Wouldnt recommend to Hitler. "
Bedeviled,2,"Mixed feelings. Some was good. Some bad, but i was scared. That's a good thing"
Bedeviled,1,"No, I'm not re-watching the excellent South Korean revenge thriller by the same name, that would just be too many great movies in one month.  No, unfortunately, I'm reviewing a much, much worse movie that tries to be hip and relevant to the times considering that it focuses on a, quite literal, killer app.  Also, this review is up later than normal considering that I just got the power back like 40 minutes ago after being without it for a grand total of 22 hours since yesterday.  It came back for, like, 30 minutes before going back out again at 5 pm yesterday and only coming back at 11:15 am today.  I hate this island and, when I leave, I'll be glad to never see it again.  The reason I mention this is that, most likely, I may stumble around a bit to remember specific details about this movie.  I don't know how professional critics do it, if they take notes or whatnot, but, as some of you may tell, that's just not my style.  Firstly, at least in my case, I don't think I can take notes and fully pay attention to a movie.  I like to just watch it, enjoy it and let my thoughts formulate after I'm done with it.  Taking notes just means I have to focus on two things at once and, really, I may end up missing key details in the film because of it.  Secondly, and most importantly, I just prefer a free-flowing style to these reviews which, again, I'm sure you can tell from how crappy they are.  I just feel that if I follow a structure, it's not gonna be as interesting for me, since I would have to stick with it and sometimes I think of things on the fly.  Regardless, I suppose that's neither here nor there.  Let's move on to this movie, shall we?  Technology has changed us, whether you feel that's for better or worse is up to you to decide, but it has changed how we live our lives.  I think that smartphones are this era's wallets.  Wallets, back in the day it seems, stored everyone's information, from social security number, to credit cards, debit cards, identification, etc, etc, etc.  The smartphone, however, has negated that since, at least in the U.S, you can use your phone to pay for meals now, you don't even have to carry cash on you anymore.  And, of course, there's still all the sensitive information you store on your phone, regardless of what it is.  Most people's lives are in their smartphones.  Having said that, this isn't the first (nor is it gonna be the last) movie to tackle this subject.  How we live our lives around technology and how, in a lot of ways, we're controlled by it.  So, yea, it's not a bad concept, but it isn't one that inspires any sort of excitement because, again, it's the type of concept you've seen before.  I think Nerve, as an example, with Dave Franco and Emma Roberts does a better job at criticizing our reliance on technology and social media than this movie does.  Though, again, in this case, it's this killer app.  I don't really know what you want me to say about this movie.  I mean it's a really bad movie.  I think, firstly, that the movie sort of drops you down into these characters' lives in the aftermath of Nikki's death.  There's no real introduction to them and who they are, you're just thrust into their lives and you're supposed to know who they are and what exactly they were to Nikki.  So, yea, we're starting off on the wrong foot already.  The thing about this movie is that, I think, it thinks that presenting itself as something more relevant to today's world and the society we live in would disguise the fact that it's just a basic, uninteresting and, quite frankly, bad horror movie.  It does engage in a bit of subterfuge in order to get its point across.  It utilizes a 'modern' way of telling its story through the use of this app, but everything that you see in how it plays out is ripped off from past, and considerably better, horror movies.  The characters are cliched and poorly written, the acting is quite bad and the horror itself is incredibly bad.  Essentially, the app uses the characters' worst fears in order to scare them to death. Which, again, isn't a new concept.  It doesn't have to be new, it just has to be interesting and fun to watch.  And, you guessed it, they don't really do anything interesting with it.  It plays out exactly like you would expect, except worse because nothing really has any weight to it.  There's a few jump scares here and there but they fall completely flat.  This is where the savage Kobe moment I mentioned a few reviews ago, where a guy pretended like he was gonna throw a ball at Kobe's face and he didn't flinch.  Well, same thing applies here.  You don't flinch, you don't even bat an eye at anything the movie attempts to do.  The horror really is quite terrible.  If, at the very least, this movie had a decent amount of gore, but it doesn't even have that.  Characters don't start dying until more than halfway through the film and, when they do start dying, the movie just runs through them until Cody and Alice are left.  Here's the thing though, Alice's boyfriend dies and Alice is understandably distraught.  Haley and Dan die later and, yet, it's like Cody and Alice don't even know, because they never acknowledge the fact that these two other people have died.  They don't mourn them, they don't do anything, so what's the point of including Haley and Dan anyway?  Just make the movie about Alice, Cody and Gavin (Alice's boyfriend), if Haley and Dan's deaths aren't gonna amount to much of anything.  The third act is also preposterously bad too.  I'm not even gonna attempt to go over it, but it's terrible and it doesn't really make a lot of sense.  Acting sucks, the writing is terrible and the horror is uninspired and lacking.  I don't know what else to say about this movie, it's just really bad and, somehow, this is even worse than Ghost House, which I already thought was bad enough.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.  But, yea, this movie is all kinds of suck and I would not recommend this to anybody.  There's nothing here for any of you.  I think this review sucks almost as much as the movie, so there you go, you can take my opinion with a grain of salt."
Bedeviled,0.5,Horrible all the way through. It just didn't make much sense. I mean this girl actually got scared to death by a teddy bear?  Come on!  No. Just no.
Bedeviled,0.5,I sat through the whole movie so the only person I can blame is myself.
Beer for My Horses,4.5,"Fun movie, not oscar material but not intended to be."
Beer for My Horses,0.5,Horrible.  Just horrible.
Beer for My Horses,3,Corny red neck movie
Beer for My Horses,1.5,I honestly have no idea how I sat through the whole thing.
Beer for My Horses,3.5,cute and enjoyable flick.noticeably good acting and good blasts from the police dog junior.
Beer for My Horses,0.5,"'Murica. That's it. That's my whole review. If I could condemn on behalf of human health safety I would. Side effects may include nausea, headaches, delirious feelings, depression and a general loss of faith in humanity."
Beer for My Horses,3.5,"""Beer for My Horses is an good comedy"". The performances are okay. The directing by Michael Salomon is good. The score and effects and excellent!"
Beer for My Horses,0.5,"Great movie, full of laughs and life lessons"
Beer for My Horses,4,"not bad, I actually enjoyed it"
Beer for My Horses,5,The combination of Rodney Carington and Toby Keith is truly hilarious!
Behaving Badly,3,It ends with the character up-chucking. That is how I felt after having endured the entire movie.
Behaving Badly,2.5,"Behaving Badly is not that bad, but it is also not the best film, I laughed at certain moments in the film, it's a little fun."
Behaving Badly,0.5,the worst movie i have watched in my entire life
Best Night Ever,5,Loved this movie! So much fun to watch and very unexpected!!!!  I've been sick w covid and this shit brought me up ...
Best Night Ever,0.5,"one of the craziest films I've ever seen, but it's really bad."
Best Night Ever,5,"This movie has received bad reviews, but honestly, I'm puzzled. I found particularly the scene wherein they are in the ambulance and then get kicked out are hilarious.  Seriously, there is shocking hilarious humor, pounding music, and the humor is constant.  I love this movie."
Best Night Ever,5,Hilarious!!! So funny!!
Best Night Ever,5,"So FUNNY to see all the men here giving bad reviews! Haha! Oh come on guys, what is the matter? There is no boobs? hahaha!! Grow up!! The movie is VERY FUNNY to everyone, finally!! Finally a comedy movie women can ALSO enjoy!! I really hope they make more of those, LESS sexual nudity and MORE funny nudity!! You ladies and sensible men will not regret! The movie is HILARIOUS!!!!"
Best Night Ever,2,"Well, it's the first original movie of the infamous directing team. And how did they do? Worse than all of their other movies. Their other movies, you have to be in the mood for really, really stupid, mind numbing, brain cell destroying comedy. However, this movie doesn't even have too much of that. This is a really dumbed down, lukewarm female version of the hangover. That's not to say that girls getting drunk and having fun can't be funny, look at bridesmaids, that was funny. And I'm sure bad moms will be great too, just haven't seen it yet. However, this movie does not have a lot of funny moments. Yes, the scenes with the naked old lady scores some laughs. Yes, the scene in the dumpster you can laugh at for its sheer stupidity, since any storyline just comes to a standstill for about 5 minutes. And yes, this movie does not take itself seriously, but not until after the ambulance scene. This movie should only be watched under special circumstances, basically if you watched dancer in the dark the night before or something to that degree to get it out of your head. Not only will you forget your troubles, you will be watching probably a better movie than the piece of crap dancer in the dark was."
Best Night Ever,0.5,This is seriously one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is ridiculous and the director is just crap. One of the scenes I'll always remember is the girls hiding in a dumpster.. the camera basically focused on them for what felt like 5 mins in the dark with nothing happening.
Best Night Ever,0.5,Watch it do you wanna feel depressed that people can make films like this.
Best Night Ever,4,"I Think it Was The Best Movie By Directors Aaron Seltzer, Jason Friedberg its Bachalor party Gone Disturbingly Wrong And It's Hilarious I Don't Know Why It Got Crappy Critics Reviews I Liked The Movie And Soundtrack Was Good Too"
Best Night Ever,4,Funny comedy. If you are looking for a laugh for no reason then this is your movie. Critics can again suck it if they've mistaken this movie for intellectual one.
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,4.5,"Not sure how they expected to get this into the country, crates and people are generally searched when it comes from luxury ships.   Why in all Irwin Allen's there's at least one massive asshole?  But the story works, the cast works and the acting is pretty good."
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,0.5,"Nothing beats the Original Poseidon Adventure where everything is messed up when the ship turns over because it's top heavy, so I give this movie what it deserves and that's a 1/2 star."
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,3,"this disaster movie itself is a disaster. but then again so was most 70s disaster movies, including the swarm which also has micheal caine. and the towering inferno was good, but also infuriating to watch. so how can you separate crap from regular good shit?"
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,3,"1979:  Needless sequel to ""The Poseidon Adventure"", as treasure hunters vs. robbers meet up at the wreckage of the sunken Poseidon to plunder  the goods.  Naturally, all get trapped in the wreckage and have to find a way out.  Somehow, they find survivors still trapped in the ship.  Hence, we have a retread of the original film.  Some survive, some don't.  OK for what it is, but it feels like deja vu all over again.  Game cast, though.  Look for an early Mark Harmon appearance."
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,1.5,"A poor rehash sequel to an average disaster film. Beyond the Poseidon Adventure is a boring disaster movie that does nothing new when compared to the last film and amazingly has even more boring cardboard cutout characters such as the rich Texan, the overprotective father, the old guy who doesn't want to make a fuss etc. How this ship was still floating after about nearly twenty explosions when combined with the first film is ridiculous. I still don't understand why the protagonists thought they couldn't go back the way they came when the antagonists easily did so. Sally Field takes the prize of being the most annoying character; saying how she was the head of this and that as some kind of comic relief at the most precarious times. I still don't understand what the audience was supposed to root for in Michael Caine; a character who was primarily interested in the treasures in the ship rather that the survivors and just happens to care about the survivors due to losing the money he was carrying with him. The only impressive thing is the production design which still holds up today. Overall, a rehashed plot with ridiculous writing and boring and cliched characters."
Black Water,1.5,It could have been better I mean it was okay they could have been a lot better and I want to watch a John Claude Van Damme movie I watch the movie cyborg or Bloodsport
Black Water,1.5,"Dolph is having a little fun while collecting his paycheck, but Van Damme is clearly bored."
Black Water,2,"Black Water has nothing that makes it memorable in time as an action movie, poor acting and very simple action scenes bury it in oblivion."
Black Water,2,I expected so much more with these two action legends attached. Neither really get a chance to shine and the story is all over the place.
Black Water,4.5,"Idk what all the other reviewer's problem was with the movie, I thought it was great. Don't expect to see a lot of Dolph Lundgren, he's not a big part. I thought Black Water was a wonderful movie. Good storyline, plenty of action, and it seemed to have an adequate budget."
Black Water,1.5,"It was a nice nod to 80's action flicks, but let's all be honest...besides John Wick, they simply don't make good action flicks anymore.  It's either unbelievable (the Rock holding a helicopter with his bare hands), or feminist (ghostbusters anyone?), or budget, like this one.   Dolph was epic as always, but for god's sake, there's no porn-star looking women that want to sleep with Jean Claude anymore, so just stop with that.  The sets were the absolute worst.  There was absolutely nothing that made me think they were on a real sub.  I mean not one thing.  I'm not being facetious when I say I could have made a more believable bridge in my garage.  Or hell, go hire Adam Savage, the guy could probably have made you a whole sub in less than a week!  Lastly, that was pretty much the worst ""captain"" I have ever seen in a movie.  The filmmaker should have gone and talked to an actual sub captain.   I appreciate the effort, at least it wasn't a huge mess of identity politics...."
Black Water,2.5,"It concerns the retrieving of some stolen flash drives, with agent Wheeler (Jean-Claude Van Damme)  being sought over and interrogated over one of them.  Black Water refers to the submarine the star is put in. It is during then Wheeler finally meets a special ops agent of Germany, Marco (Dolph Lundgren)"
Black Water,2,This movie was absolute garbage. Grew up watching these guys and enjoyed their movies but it's time to hang up certain aspects of their roles. First problem is you have 60+ year old JCVD bedding hot 20-30 somethings like back in his heyday. Not even close to realistic now. 
Black Water,2,"Lundgren probably contributed about a day's worth of shooting to the very inappropriately named Black Water. JCVD, occupying the other space on the cover, is actually a lead role in the movie though, but he hasn't been in a good movie in years so that's doesn't bode particularly well. The real problems with Black Water are less to do with the actors though (most of whom are, admittedly, bad) and more to do with the fact that that it doesn't offer a single thing that's original, or even an unoriginal thing done well. The way it is going to end up is completely transparent from the word go, and a couple of minimal-level of acceptable action sequences alongside a Dolph cameo, do nothing to change that."
Black Water,5,JCVD style. `90 never die. fun & easy. enjoy it.
Born to Be Wild,4,As a 10 year old in 1995 the final scene when the camera pans away and the gorilla ran off into the wild I ugly cried for the first time watching a movie.
Born to Be Wild,2,Forgettable version of a story told a million times before.
Born to Be Wild,5,literally best movie I have ever seen
Born to Be Wild,3.5,Good movie overall with a funny & heart-warming message for the whole family to enjoy
Born to Be Wild,3,"wrong synopsis morons. great movie from my childhood. the bond between a Young youth and gorilla is very fun, funny and touching. I highly recommend this for the family. also featuring John C McGinley with a kooky role."
Born to Be Wild,5,this is good for nothing but not the one what is the funny one which is the gorilla named katie grabbed rick's burger and rick drives off and left the others
Born to Be Wild,3,"Cliché-laden family film, elevated by a good leading performance from Will Horneff, realistic-looking gorilla, and strong message about respecting animals."
Born to Be Wild,3,"I think its ok, I like it"
Born to Be Wild,3.5,I loved this movie as a child!It was pretty funny!
Born to Be Wild,5,~~AwSuM MoViE..HaPpY & SaD MoViE~~
Breaking Point,0.5,Disappointing screenplay and predictable plot.
Breaking Point,2,"bearable, but not too interesting action movie"
Breaking Point,4,4 stars just because i was lost who and what was blackmailing who in the movie.. by the end i figured it out
Breaking Point,0.5,"Another terrible movie.  Extremely depressing and just plain stupid."
Breaking Point,2.5,"Pretty decent courtroom/crime drama with two underrated stoic actors....Tom Berenger and Armand Assante, both of whom give nice performances in their respective roles as the obvious goodie and baddie, I don't think I need to say who was who. This kind of plot and film has been done many times before and allot better than this but this is still a good film for what its worth and does give you some nice dramatic moments of emotion with tense strong scenes of violence."
Breaking Point,5,"Very good film, Tom Berenger He act from 10, Tom Berenger is great and legendary actor."
Breaking Point,2.5,Nothing special - entertaining enough... Tom Berenger what ever happened to you? Armand Assante - never quite made the big time...
Breaking Point,2,"This was a film I could have done without. With the disturbing violence and unoriginal story, you are left with a numbing cessation at the very end."
Breaking Point,2.5,"I'm tired of the blue tint movies. Having said that lets move on. A very conniving and bleak film all the way until the end which wrapped up very tidily... a bit more neatly then I liked. It was hard to like all but two of the characters and they were not the main ones. It was definitely worth a look, but it is a renter not a buyer."
Cabin Fever,0.5,"I wish I could rate this less than half a star! Absolutely horrendous acting, how are movies this bad even released haha director needs a new job I think"
Cabin Fever,0.5,"If I could give this ZERO stars, I would (RT has changed over the years). None of the Cabin Fever movies were any good, not even the first one (I don't care how ""better"" it is compared to this), but this movie...I can't think if it's worse or even just as bad as the second one (the one with the prom/dance)."
Cabin Fever,2,"While being an alright remake it lacks everything the original had- humour and lots of gore. Also YOU CAN'T REPLACE WINSTON! I'm sure this change was made as Giuseppe went dark unfortunately but still, leave him out. It is also way way to serious for a cabin fever film."
Cabin Fever,0.5,No need for a quarantine -- enthusiasm for this inert remake is not contagious.
Cabin Fever,1,"Holy shit.  By far one of the WORST remakes I've ever seen. I understand it's not a reboot, it's a remake. But fuck dude, you don't film each scene the exact same scene as the original but with shitty acting and absolute no humor at all. I'm just... I hate this. Only reason it got the 1 star treatment and not a .5 is because some of that musical score was really hair raising.... until the characters started talking again"
Caffeine,1.5,"One critics is correct, a sitcom."
Caffeine,3,"Largely unfunny and catastrophically amateurish but still slightly interesting, holding my attention to the end! "
Caffeine,1.5,Soft core porn gone wrong.
Caffeine,3,delightful bubbly comedy with lots of NRG
Caffeine,1,Don't waste your time.  Saw this for Katherine Heigl but she's not a major player.
Caffeine,5,It's like a british version of Waiting.
Caffeine,1.5,"story was very bland, acting wasn't all kinds of great, and only was good for a few laughs"
Caffeine,4.5,absolutely hilarious
Caffeine,4,"Funny, whimsical and unfolding. Clever screenplay. Surprisingly non-cheesy ending. One of the better cult movies."
Caffeine,0.5,This movie is absolutely awful. Has no direction & I would not recommend it.
Christmas Eve,4,Quirky and amusing light entertainment.
Christmas Eve,3,I perfectly fine/ok one time watch.
Christmas Eve,5,Super surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie
Christmas Eve,5,James Roday is killer in this
Christmas Eve,5,Love James Roday in this.  Psych fans should see this
Christmas Eve,5,Don't let the score fool you.  Great indie flick!
Christmas Eve,5,Great indie Christmas movie.  Surprised it is so under the radar
Christmas Eve,0.5,Just another reason for those who hate the holidays to hate the holidays.
Christmas Eve,5,What a great film full of the true spirit of Christmas!
Christmas Eve,4,"Loved this intertwining stories of people stuck in elevators on Christmas Eve. The critics are nuts, this is a really heartwarming movie that was very enjoyable to watch."
Cold Blood,2,"While it has an always capable performance by Jean Reno (Le Chef, The Day of the Crows) it's a very boring and generic Thriller that isn't worth your time"
Cold Blood,2.5,"Minha opinião: Um filme policial, meio suspense. Onde Jean é um assassino profissional, onde ele pega um trabalho para matar um empresário. E assim que ele termina o trabalho vai o meio da neve, onde judas perdeu as botas. A filha se levanta para vingar morte do pai. Descobre onde esta Jean, porém antes de chegar ao local, ela se acidenta. Jean sem saber quem é ela, ele salva a vida dela. Nisso um outro assassino vai para mata-lo. Mas o tempo ruim de tempestade de neve agrava todo o processo. Até que ela tenta mata-lo, mas ele sai vivo e descobre toda a trama dela. Ele manda ela embora, mas os lobos a ataca e jean a salva mas leva o tiro e morrrrr.                                     "
Cold Blood,0.5,"Waste of time. No story, no point."
Cold Blood,1,Total a waste of time.
Cold Blood,2.5,Lots of dramatic pieces leading up to a letdown.
Cold Blood,3,"Not too bad. The stuff between Henry and Melody played out really well and I enjoyed their interaction, just didn't like all the other stuff where they were been tracked down. It just spoilt the flow of the story for me."
Cold Blood,1.5,"The only good thing about this movie is the scenery.  Other than that, I cannot recommend it.  The plot didn't make any sense.  And the acting, other than from Reno, was very poor.  And while the locations were beautiful (and as others have stated), why pretend that the movie takes place in the US when it is obvious that is not?"
Cold Blood,0.5,This movie was actually very broing. You don't realise it at first because it has elements of a psycholigcal thriller and that is good enough for the first 50 minutes. However the movie is pitched as having action elements and the story would have you beleive that also. There are 2 pictures of guns on the front cover.....you would be lucky if there is a single shot fired in this movie. You don't realise that until the end and then you realise how boring this movie was.
Cold Blood,1.5,"I try to understand the connection between all the characters but I can't. Even when the credit rolls end, I am still puzzled."
Cold Blood,1.5,"Not so much bad as it was just a complete waste of time. And I don't mean just mine. Essentially, nothing that happens matters."
Cover,4,"Excellent movie, surprise ending"
Cover,2.5,This film held my interest. I was definitely surprised about the husband. Aunjanue Ellis is a fine actress. Great cast.
Cover,5,"This movie is no joke, loved it"
Cover,5,Leon gave an all-star performance
Cover,5,FBF please ex specially women please this is no jock I love you all and you know I can't hold nothing in u know I don't like 2 hide who I am
Cover,5,Love it. no way to know what was coming.  Love it
Cover,3.5,I am mad about the ending. I would have liked to know their status at the end.
Cover,3.5,About a six-hanky movie for me; very touching!
Cover,2.5,Good movie. I watched it because Leon was in it. He did not disappoint.
Cover,3.5,"An  unexpectedly good drama about family, marriage and murder.  Directed by the underrated Bill Duke."
Dark Crimes,5,"Thoughtful, intelligent, horrifying. Jim Carrey is amazing in this performance. It made me think of Ingmar Bergman movies."
Dark Crimes,2,Sonic lord king lord evil lord of lord lord
Dark Crimes,2.5,One of the most unfairly dismissed films in the history of unfair dismissal. 'Dark Crimes' is an excessively well-shot exercise in atmosphere and other European thriller isms. The screenwriter really could have put more effort into the correlating drama between the character's personal lives and the crimes being investigated.
Dark Crimes,5,"At first, I had to do a double take when I realized it was Jim Carrey. He is the total opposite of what people expect of him. This is a very good crime movie. I rather enjoyed it. I watch a lot of foriegn films abd series. I think Tadek can have his own series. I love crime shows. Everyone should give this movie a view at least once."
Dark Crimes,1,The only way to enjoy this film is to have a shot every time Jim Carrey opens and closes a door. You will be smashed within five minutes and won't be able to see within ten. Which is good cause this film is not worth seeing.
Dark Crimes,1,"I could call it a trainwreck but this was nowhere near as exciting as a trainwreck.  Painstakingly slow like molasses and bland like plain uncooked oatmeal, with moments of perversion sprinkled throughout.  It's biggest positive is that it is captivating and it is only 90 minutes long and by the time I checked there was only around 20 minutes."
Dark Crimes,0.5,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. You can't follow the plot. You don't care about the characters. You just want this to be over and end.
Dark Crimes,5,"First, ignore all reviews that bemoan Jim Carrey not succumbing to typecasting to play another idiot-satisfying-level comedian role (""The Mask"" being Carryey's notable exception, with an instant-classic comedic portrayal including superb physical acting)."
Dark Crimes,3,"It is well shot and Carrey is very different in the film, almost emotionless."
Dark Crimes,0.5,I was blown away that this movie had Jim Carrey in it and was downright awful. I felt like somebody who had never written before took over the script. I genuinely want to know what moron butchered this so that they never work in Hollywood again.
Dark Tide,5,"I quite obviously hold the minority opinion here, but Dark Tide delivers on all its promises for a shark thriller. While it may not be your pick if you're looking for loads of blood, gore, and carnage, Dark Tide is packed full of gorgeous visuals and an interesting plot. I won't give you the windows to wall synopsis here (that's available on google), but the gist of it is marine biologist/shark expert Kate is dealing with some pretty heavy guilt surrounding the death of her colleague and friend and ends up pushing her limits by taking an ill-fated trip to Shark Alley. I would've loved to see more discussion of trauma at the beginning of the film when we're learning about Kate, but that's just me! Something else to note is that a good chunk of the movie is filmed at night, meaning the screen is quite dark, limiting visibility. Dark Tide isn't going to be your cup of tea if you just want a short, entertaining cult shark film with all the cheap CGI and gore, but if you find sharks just super fascinating and would be satisfied to see lots of clips of them swimming around (super majesticly in my opinion) with Kate and the other characters, then look no further! I really liked it, but you'll just have to watch for yourself to find out if you do too."
Dark Tide,0.5,Poor acting and an even poorer plot!  Tries to be clever by using footage of real sharks but the real sharks are the only thing to get any pass marks in this film.
Dark Tide,4,"I love shark films and this one does a nice job of showing them in their natural habitat as well as what they're capable of. I've watched horror films my whole life and it's ONLY shark films that have ever given me the heebie-jeebies. The dangerous situation Berry's character puts the other characters into is unprofessional and unforgivable, and yet it's never addressed - I hate that in films."
Dark Tide,1,"Dear God this is a boring and depressing movie! In all honesty I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes because I couldn't take it one more minute, even after watching most of it and that meaning I wouldn't know what happened. At that point I couldn't have cared less if they all got eaten by sharks, I really didn't care. I just needed it to stop. It is surprising to me that Halle Berry would be in such an awful film but here we are and man is it awful!!"
Dark Tide,0.5,"I don't usually write bad reviews, but this movie has GOT to be an exception! This is perhaps one of the worse movies I have ever seen in my life! The acting on this movie made me want to rip out my eyeballs, slather them with STEAK sauce and EAT THEM JUST so I can never see this movie again! This movie is AWFUL! I don't say that lightly either! I love Halle Berry, but I don't EVER want to see her in something like this again! The plot was dumb! The effects were OK! The acting was AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! Did anyone preview this before it was released? Did ANY executive actually think it was good? What was the director thinking? This movie was so bad that I can't even believe that someone edited this and said ""YEAH! We have a hit!"". NO! This movie literally has NO direction! It is like watching someone go to the bathroom. I am watching this on YouTube. I think it is even too bad for YouTube! It isn't a B move. It isn't even a D movie! It is a Z MINUS movie! The ONE funny thing is watching Olivier Martinez be himself - a hothead ready to fight! Other than that, if someone ever made me watch this movie again, I would KILL them and I don't even mind saying that out loud! Thank god I am doing stuff while I am watching this! If I went to a theater, I would be REAL PISSED!"
Dark Tide,4,"Shark movie fans will love this. With decent cinematography and real footage, it delivers exactly what you would expect - a solid, easy to watch shark thriller with the added bonus of Halle Berry playing the lead."
Dark Tide,5,Before the Meg there was Dark Tide! Great action thriller and SHARKS!
Dark Tide,4,"I actually didn't think this movie was bad. I thought it was a solidly-good shark thriller, with a lot of real grit and a lot of impressive real, on-location footage with the sharks. Halle and the other cast, particularly Olivier and Luke Tyler, do a great job! I've watched it several times! Good music, scenery, cinematography, pacing--not bad at all. :)"
Dark Tide,0.5,0 stars isn't an option
Dark Tide,0.5,"This movie pissed me off more then a dozen times. One, sharks do  attack sometimes. Keyword sometimes, they DO NOT FUCKING ATTACK and come back to finish the job. I hate Hollywood for demonizing sharks and making them look like evil fish that just love human flesh. It is literally a fact that after an attack the shark never re-applies itself to finish the job. In the finale scenes where tommy gets his legs eaten and the dad is taken out of the water, in those weather conditions is absolutely absurd, and outright ridiculous! I have personally gone swimming with sharks. Not a great white, but many different breeds of sharks. This is utterly sickening and is upsetting, to a point where Hollywood should be completely shut down in the department of shark movies. This was so beyond what's realistic. They make these sharks out to be like some scyfy human flesh crazed  killing machine. I felt as though the acting was  goodd, had a good story line but was not thought or accurate at all when it comes to sharks. Overall I don't even give this one star due to the sheer shit respect the director and producer have for sharks."
Darkness Rising,0.5,"The story is confusing and the acting is campy and really bad.  I think the f-bomb was dropped at least 1,000 times and totally without benefit.  Not worth the time to watch. You've been warned..."
Darkness Rising,5,Indie movie that have a Legend storie and a visual better than 80% of greats horror movies at least
Darkness Rising,0.5,It sucked.  Beginning scene and ending scene was never tied in to the central theme.
Darkness Rising,0.5,"Fucking sucks... no wonder why they made $12,000 "
Darkness Rising,1.5,"The single greatest evidence that, yes, you can indeed overact in films in 2019. One minor noise, everyone lashes out and loses their minds. The CGI is abundently fresh-out-of-college style editing."
Darkness Rising,3,"A 3 bc my interest was held until the end, hoping to get answers and understanding... but I didn't."
Darkness Rising,5,"Never trust the critics, I read a lot of those who gave The Last Jedi a 91% score, this is a typical popcorn movie, it's fun to watch. The actors in my opinion did a pretty decent job and even if it's not an Scorcese movie it fulfilled my expectations."
Darkness Rising,3.5,"Really enjoyed this one. The effects were great, the backstory was intriguing, and the ending was surprising."
Darkness Rising,2,The ending kind of saves it. Pretty mediocre acting and slow story line. 
Darkness Rising,2,"For a horror movie made in 2017, this movie could have been so much better... I am severely disappointed."
Days and Nights,1.5,"A peculiar, unfamiliar drama that lacks every aspect of a good movie."
Days and Nights,2,"Gloomy and tragic throughout. A few warmer moments shine through, but overall a pretty dark flick."
Days and Nights,1.5,Bit of a strange movie. Very hard to follow.
Days and Nights,2,"A family unites at a country house, and old wounds open as the patriarch confronts his failing health."
Days and Nights,4,"It starts slowly than it gets better and better, with some special moments, but it loses something just at the end. Anyway I enjoyed it a lot."
Days and Nights,2.5,All the actors did a great job but the story line was tough on this gal who was looking for a light weight movie on a Sat night!
Days and Nights,2.5,"Superb cast and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, it feels experimental (at best)."
Days and Nights,5,"Days and Nights is an amazing and captivating film. It's definitely worth the watch. The mix of tragedy and heart wearing comedy blend perfectly throughout the whole hour and a half. I look forward to watching this movie many more times. Christian Camargo is a talented writer, director, and actor. And it really shows in this film!"
Days and Nights,5,"A true work of art which we enjoyed from beginning to end. Hauntingly gorgeous music, acting and cinematography.  Our glasses are raised to Chekhov for providing the inspiration and to a fearless cast which triumphs all the way."
Days and Nights,1,"I absolutely HATED this movie. It made me so annoyed I wanted to punch the screen. Have never been so annoyed by the insipidness of a movie in my life... how could someone turn Chekov into such pointless, mindless crap about people who think they are so important and deep but have the depth or wet tissue paper"
Dead Man's Curve,5,this movie is INSANE ohmygod please watch it lmao
Dead Man's Curve,3.5,"A good cast and interesting plot make for an entertaining watch. It's not winning any academy awards, but I found it fun and enjoyable."
Dead Man's Curve,4,"I love this movie, I now, the end is a little bit confused, but Matthew Lillard shine in this movie"
Dead Man's Curve,4,"Overall, I like this movie more than most people. There's something about this film that I've always loved, and it actually impacted me in a big way. To this day I would class this film a proud guilty pleasure within my film collection. Over the top acting and consistent twists and turns are all fun to me. As far as plot, for 1998 this was something different and something fresh and I had never seen any film like it. Considering this was a directional debut, there were also many creative choices which still bring a smile to my face until the credits roll.  8.4/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
Dead Man's Curve,4,"A pretty solid film from first time writer/director Dan Rosen. 90's nostalgia certainly adds some charm to this film, as does a reliably quirky performance by Matthew Lillard. The plot gets a bit muddled, but there is some interesting camerawork, and some great monologue delivery, again aided by Lillard's unique touch. If you're a fan of 90's teen movies, this one is a fun, dark addition to the genre."
Dead Man's Curve,3.5,"The Curve is a slick and smart college thriller with a clever, plot twist-filled narrative and features a great young cast including Michael Vartan, Keri Russell and terrific performance from Matthew Lillard."
Dead Man's Curve,1.5,"Oh boy.  I don't remember this being this bad... Cool story, basically being a thriller version of Dead Man on Campus, but horrible acting and dialog and the most despicable characters makes this almost unbearable."
Dead Man's Curve,5,saw it when it came out in 1998 i've been trying yo see it again can't find anywhere.
Dead Man's Curve,3,"This thriller had me really enjoying it - if you can get past the silly premise, the set up of the crime and the initial twist was fairly gripping. The acting is above average, and I always enjoy seeing Dana Delaney in a movie regardless of how big the role. After building up a good head of steam, all heck broke loose at the end and what seemed to be a well crafted story veered into absurdity. Good enough to watch, but not as good as it could have been."
Dead Man's Curve,3,"I've seen better but I've seen worse.  It's one of those fun scary movies.  Could just be my infatuation with Matthew Lillard too! Either way, I'm not sorry I saw it.  So, if your bored, give it a chance."
Death of a Nation,0.5,Another attempt to divide this country even more... how sad. :(
Death of a Nation,5,So good! Dinesh gives us all a different perspective of Politics and that to me is priceless
Death of a Nation,1,I'm convinced that any documentaries that this pardoned criminal makes is pure fantasy
Death of a Nation,0.5,"I want to say that you can't make this up, but D'Souza obviously did. I'm not sure at what point Dinesh lost complete touch with reality and began peddling myth as truth, but this isn't simply preaching to the choir it's preaching to the in(s)ane."
Death of a Nation,4,About FREEDOM
Death of a Nation,5,"It's obviously a right leaning documentary, but it was refreshing to see the other point of view for once, even if i don't agree with it."
Death of a Nation,0.5,"Inaccurate propaganda, plain and simple. Doesn't even attempt to present itself as any level of coherent."
Death of a Nation,5,Phenomenal movie!! Death of a Nation is absolutely worth the purchase to rent. I enjoyed the way the story flowed. I ended up purchasing three other D'Souza films and bindged them in a weekend.
Death of a Nation,5,"Another excellent film by Dinesh. It is self-evident the disdain the left has for its own history and subsequent analogous standing in current American social behavior, dialogue, and politics as outlined in this film and as definitively illustrated by the 0% approval rating from leftist critics on here. As put forth in the film, the left as conveniently and mendaciously inverted, subverted, and revised American political history, suppressing its reprehensible culpability while simultaneously attempting to smear an opposing political party, along with its supporters, with the very evils they themselves are guilty of."
Death of a Nation,5,I have never seen more clearcut evidence of a partisan rating site claiming to be objective.
Delirium,2.5,"Tom's been in a mental institution, and when's he's released to his haunted family home, things begin to come out about the family history.  Daddy had mom captive in the basement and big brother's a killer.  But, mixed with mental issues and 'needing his pills' - you're not really sure what's reality or what is in his head."
Delirium,5,"Wow. I went into this movie expecting little and boy was I pleasantly surprised. I don't know how I never knew this movie existed until now but this is a great movie. It's so good compared to most of the trash that comes out. Why are so many other Blumhouse movies marketed and receive so much fanfare but I heard nothing about this movie?! Forget the Annabelle movies, why wasn't this marketed to all hell?! This is the best Blumhouse movie I've seen so far. It's not perfect but it's a great movie."
Delirium,4,"Contrary to many of the reviews left, Delirium brought a huge turn of events in a thriller-packed movie. A twist on many other recent horror-thrillers that keeps audiences on their toes and constantly has us at the edge of our seats. Quite refreshing to see a director taking a different approach to scaring its viewers."
Delirium,3,"As a horror fan I cannot resist seeing a film with a 0% fresh rating from the critics. Is it possible for a film to be that bad? Yes, but not this one. It's worth at least 50-60% -- it's not a great film and to be fair, I'm not a fan of the ""found footage"" genre, in part because it's so impossible to create the whole narrative with the characters filming everything so they have to cut to conventional shots and then back to the ""found footage"" but that's not the worst thing in this film. The sequence that bores me the most is the ""walking slowly in the dark"" thing which happens to often and goes on too long in horror films and this film is little else bit that. Other that that, it's not a bad gag, that characters are just unlikable enough (basically young jerks punking each other constantly) to make sense in the film's world. Definitely not a 0% movie and if you're a fan of ""found footage"" you'll probably like this a lot."
Delirium,3.5,Another example of trusting audience reviews over critics.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Effective scares and believable characters.  And a great twist. Worth a watch.
Delirium,0.5,"Why even bother making this movie. Story is bad, acting is bad, direction for it is bad. There's not a single thing this movie does to keep the watcher interested in it."
Delirium,3.5,"This is a pretty solid psychological thriller. Topher Grace does a decent enough job in the role, and the movie keeps you guessing throughout. The twist at the end comes out of nowhere, but it's still believable and it makes sense. It has its issues, but a 0% is a bit harsh"
Delirium,2,"Contained in every way. Topher never seems believable as a tortured soul or in a serious role for that matter. And Patricia Clarkson has morphed into a butch cop typecast who has no reason to exist in this world other than to provide pacing. This film is a head scratcher, not because it has depth to it, but rather why did this get made."
Delirium,5,I haven't even looked at the other reviews because I didn't want them to taint my experience. I loved this movie. It was different from everything that's been released lately and it's worth watching.
Delirium,5,The critics really miss the mark on this one. 
Dogging: A Love Story,3.5,"This is never going to get  a big audience and it does seem absolutely barking mad it ever got made... but having said that it has some genuinely moving, funny and crude moments."
Dogging: A Love Story,0.5,"Very, very silly, gratuitous and sordid.  If it was meant to be a comedy, it wasn't funny."
Dogging: A Love Story,2,Not as unique as Sleeping Dogs Lie but a unique romantic comedy.A couple times I just wanted to turn it off because it got boring in parts but I just could not do it ( I wonder why....) I think it's worth watching at least once but not more then once
Dogging: A Love Story,3.5,"I quite enjoyed this movie, funny, suspense, story lines a little bid different but overall the story kept you wanting to keep watching. Amazing what a bit of kinky sex will do, in this instance it sorted everything out lol...."
Dogging: A Love Story,3.5,Out of the ordinary mockumentary that keeps the audience guessing what is going on... And most importantly: how would all end??!!
Dogging: A Love Story,2.5,"saw this awhile back, ""do you wanna go to the dog park?"""
Dogging: A Love Story,3,better than I thought it would be
Dogging: A Love Story,1.5,awfully boring & simply awful. All the British slangs had me lost . Thanks to urban dictionary i learnt a new slang
Dogging: A Love Story,2,"Sadly, another example of how a near genius story with a both a sexy and funny base to operate from can be ruined by reverting and ending on cliches."
Dogging: A Love Story,2,"Dogging is as British as Earl Grey tea and frozen football pitches on windy January afternoon, and it is definitely an interesting subject in which to base a film upon. In case you are wondering, Wikipedia defines the sexual act of dogging as;engaging in sexual act/s in a semi-public place (typically a secluded car park in a car) and then watching others doing so. This sexual act (or acts) is the pretext for the loose romantic plot behind Simon Elliss first feature-film in which four peoples lives and relationships revolve around the act of dogging."
Ed,5,it was great and funny chimpanzee movie of all time about baseball
Ed,2,"Well, it is probably better than Air Bud..."
Ed,0.5,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD! This has fart jokes, Adult humor, Drunk driving, a magic coin toss, money signs in eyes, and baseball being play 3 TIMES!!"
Ed,2.5,If you like monkeys and baseball then you might enjoy it. Not a great family comedy or great comedy in general but Matt LeBlanc does okay at best in his performance. The plot is stupid and there are better baseball movies such as The Sandlot and Rookie of the Year but there is a few laughs here that kids might enjoy.
Ed,4,Really it is not that bad and I like this movie.  Critics and everyone that does not like it I can understand why.  It is really a harmless movie. The villain woman from
Ed,0.5,This movie is literally unwatchable. It's all one joke that gets old real quick.
Ed,2,Most people just get a dog.
Ed,0.5,Worst thing since the holocaust.  I don't think there should be anymore to say about this crap;  just don't see it
Ed,1,Saturday matinee sewage.
Ed,0.5,There are no words to describe how awful and painful this was to watch...
Eulogy for a Vampire,1,"Really, really, really bad film making.  The film is of a poor quality rarely seen.  The director does not seem to realize that a scene can change without requiring an establishing shot -- actually, virtually the same establishing shot every time, showing the steeple of a church -- which is completely unnecessary because the ENTIRE STORY happens in the same monastery, so no one in the audience is likely to be asking, ""Where are they now?""  The makeup and special effects (i.e., ""blood"") look like things my sister and I did at Halloween when we were 10 years old.  The acting? -- someone really raised the dead to cast this horror flick!  Nevertheless, the story was slightly coherent and diverting, saving the film from a 1/2 star rating."
Father of Invention,3,Would've been nice back story if they mentioned the mother had been sleeping with middle eastern man.
Father of Invention,5,"I thought it was really funny and touching. My technicality mind was caught up on why he was ruined and sent to prison when the company he ran produced the product. That is the purpose of having a company. The company is liable for anything bad that happens because of its products, not the head of the company."
Father of Invention,0.5,"Incredibly shitty. Bad acting, dumb story, bad casting, 10/10 would not recommend. Literally become a rotten tomatoes reviewer just to say DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! "
Father of Invention,3,Father of Invention - 3 out of 5- this movie is smart funny lots of inside cracks and off color jokes. The saving grace of this film was Kevin Spacey who makes any film good. This is a rent not worth buying
Father of Invention,3,"Recently released from prison, a former millionaire (Kevin Spacey) must reinvent himself before he can rebuild his infomercial empire."
Father of Invention,5,Kevin Spacey delivers another great performance!
Father of Invention,1.5,"To make great drama, you need it to be ultimately believable: to do great comedy, you have to make it laugh-out-loud funny, enough that the unbelievable moments don't matter. Like many films, this opts for a half-in, half-out approach that neither approaches believability, nor humour."
Father of Invention,0.5,ATROCIOUS.NEVER WATCH THIS.KEVIN SPACEY: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?!?!?
Father of Invention,3.5,"Not a great movie, but I loed how it ends..."
Father of Invention,2,"Maybe it's because we've come to expect so much of Spacey with all the dark and wry characters he's played, but this is just bland and far too sentimental."
Foolish,1.5,"The standup wasn't the worst, but the rest of the movie is unfunny and incoherent."
Foolish,2,"This movie doesn't know whether to be a stand-up show or a romantic comedy. Eddie Griffin really tries here, but his co-stars hold him back hard. Eddie is much better these days."
Foolish,5,lOVE THIS MOVIE 1 OF MY FAVORITES
Foolish,5,one of my all time favorites!!!
Foolish,2.5,LMAO... THIS SHIT STOOPID...
Foolish,1.5,Ohhh Eddie Griffin..
Foolish,2,"No real story, uninteresting characters, and bad standup courtesy of <a href=""http://www.flixster.com/actor/eddie-griffin"">Eddie Griffin</a>."
Foolish,2,"ialways wanted to see this when iwas younger and youtube had it in the movies section and it made me laugh a couple times, Eddie Griffin is still one ofmy favorite comedians"
Been Rich All My Life,4.5,I Loved it. it was endearingly sweet portrait of a group of ladies who simply said love doing what they do. As I enter my later middle years of my life and things begin to break down and the signs of our inevitable mortality loom larger this film is a life affirmation! I totally encourage everyone to sink in for a wonderful sweet ride.
Been Rich All My Life,5,what an amazing story of five women with a zest for life and a talent for tap dance.  I enjoyed every minute of their lives - past and present.  They are an inspiration for anyone who worries about turning 80.
Been Rich All My Life,4,"This documentary studies life-long chorus girls now known as the Silver Belles, all in their 80s and 90s now and still dancing. Demonstrates the true meaning of zest for life, endurance, passion and above all friendship. Excellent documentary with some nice special features on the DVD including, Learning to do the Shim Sham."
Been Rich All My Life,4.5,"An endearing look at some of the original Harlem showgirls, putting on a repertoire from their 1930s dance ensemble.  Upllifting and fascinating look into the early half of the 19th Century entertainment business in NYC."
Been Rich All My Life,4,"A very charming film about The Silver Belles Dance Troupe, that is comprised of women, who had danced in choruses, at The Cotton Club, and The Apollo Theaters, in Harlem, some of them beginning in the late 1920's."
Been Rich All My Life,5,"These elderly ladies make me feel like I'm wasting my life. They've led, and continue to lead, fascinating lives.  I only wish I could hang out with them for real."
Been Rich All My Life,4,what an opportunity -- makes me jealous of the filmmaker for having even more time than the movie gives us to spend time with these ladies.  this is what ny is all about!
Been Rich All My Life,5,"This is such an awesome film on so many levels.  It gives us first person insights into the Harlem Renaissance -- an incredibly important and fascinating time period.  It also offers visible proof of the value of remaining active throughout one's life.  And finally, these women are so great I smiled through the whole movie."
Been Rich All My Life,1.5,i dont c d point it does not apply to me but i like d idea though
Been Rich All My Life,4.5,"I am baised since heather is basically family. But, I love the sprits of all of these ladies, to meet them in person is amazing and Heather has done such a great job of capturing that on screen."
Haunt,3.5,My rating for the film is a 7.7/10
Haunt,3.5,"I wouldve gave this movie a higher score but the main characters are too dumb. For example they can kill one of the bad guys numerous times while hes down but they let him survive and then he keeps coming back. How stupid are they? Aside from that cool movie, different, new and fresh."
Haunt,5,I loved this movie. Scary stuff.
Haunt,3.5,"For me, Haunt is a welcome return to good slasher movies. It has the usual elements that made movies from the same genre successful. Good jump scares and thrills that will keep you on edge. Story is of course formulaic, but it has the potential to spawn new iconic characters because it features killers wearing different masks. Some deaths are pretty brutal and will surely satisfy gore fans. I like how the movie features puzzles and traps like those in the Saw franchise. The ending might leave you hanging with more questions though -- maybe to make way for a possible sequel. Scare factor is high and lots of scenes are very unnerving."
Haunt,4.5,"I love slashers, and Haunt is a great entry in the modern slasher catalogue. Using the already uneasy world of extreme haunted houses as the backdrop it creates an environment you can't trust. What works best is that for a large chunk of the movie you're not sure if the scares are genuine danger, or just part of the haunted house experience. On top of that the house itself is a set designers wet dream with massive creativity. Finally, the characters are actually decent. Special shout out to our final girl who goes through a great arc and has genuine emotion in her ordeal. It's a seasonal slasher movie all right, but it's a damn good one."
Haunt,2,"The movie is intense and shot well. But to be honest that's call the film really has going for it. There's a lot of lack of explanation for everything, and all the characters except the main one (marginally) lack any sort of essence. A good one if you want to watch a fairly standard graphic non thinking horror."
Haunt,4,"For slasher horror movies this is pretty much top shelf. It has tension, thrills, and chills. A must see for horror fans."
Haunt,4,"A very decent horror movie with all the desired ingredients: disturbing villains, gore and a lot of suspense. A bit reminiscent of the various escape room flicks that came out the last few years whereas this one sticks out though."
Haunt,1,"It was a shutter stock horror film. The characters, setting and plot were all cookie cutter, bringing nothing new or really interesting to the table."
Haunt,4,"Haunted houses may not be always scary, but Haunt takes on the genre of shock/brutal houses popularized by McKamey Manor. The gore is good, the suspense is well-balanced, and most of the kills are both shocking and creative. It's still a bit paint-by-the-numbers, but overall, this is a great flick for a gory night in."
Thor: Love and Thunder,1.5,"I loved Ragnarok (and I really liked all of Taika Waititi's other movies), but this was like the palest shadow of that. The jokes all fell flat, the plot points seemed horribly forced, Bale was wasted. Russell Crowe was ok. I'd honestly rather watch the Eternals again."
The Black Phone,5,"Du caralho, filme maravilhoso."
The Black Phone,4,A few plot holes don't prevent the movie to provide a very tense experience.
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2,Let's face it it's bollocks. Well acted but the plot is now cuckolded by the impressive special effects and the new law of thermodynamics which maintains everything related to superheroes must be fantastic.
Lightyear,1.5,Movie Rating:   3/10
Lightyear,0.5,"Barf. Way to ruin a good idea. Nothing original. Dragged on and on and on and on. Who wrote this? Major ""original"" idea is the lesbian marriage. Newsflash---I would have taken my 4 grandkids to see this, BUT..............sorry, not happening. Do what you want in private, jamming that down our throats at every turn and calling us names will not work. So sad. Got rid of Tim, but even he would not have saved such a bad script."
The Bob's Burgers Movie,3.5,"Bob's Burgers is a whimsically good time. Gentle laughs, sweet songs and colourful animation make it a treat on the eyes. Don't worry if you haven't seen the show, there are plenty of burgers to go round."
The Bob's Burgers Movie,4,"The Bob's Burgers Movie is able to do something that other examples of tv shows-turned-movies have trouble doing: it stays true to the show. Where you'll often find stakes raised to absurd levels, like towns being encased in domes, here we have a story that stays at a believable yet whimsical scope."
The Conversation,5,A stone-cold classic.
The Conversation,2.5,"The story was suspenseful and full of thrill but the loose direction made this movie a mess. The movie starts with unexplained plot and carries on. Some of the scenes in between are so much boring. The suspense reveal at the end and the overall tense environment creation were the only thing that worked properly in the movie. Overall, one time watch for me."
The Conversation,3,"It's slow-paced, just like I had expected it to be, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. A slow pace gives credit to a movie like The Conversation, although one has to be prepared beforehand. But everyone does a great job, from Coppola to Hackman and the rest of the cast. A must-watch classic, but at the same time, just like someone else said: just because it was one of the first, doesn't mean it was the best. But of course, it would always hold its pioneer status, and that is more than enough."
The Conversation,5,An early movie about privacy. Gene Hackman is great. Very relevant in a time of diminishing privacy.
The Conversation,5,"Loved this thriller! Gene Hackman is riveting in this movie, a young Harrison Ford plays a great assistant. I recommend this film!"
The Wobblies,5,A entertaining and informative introduction to the IWW.
The Wobblies,2.5,excellent archival documents woven into some wonderful interviews from a series of talking heads affiliated with the IWW.... be forewarned the sound is pretty muddled which is a shame with all those great Wobbly songs.
The Wobblies,4,"An excellent introduction to the IWW, both its history and its working philosophy.  I would say this is fair and unbiased in its presentation, but I know that anti-IWW folks would probably disagree.  Possibly the greatest point of disagreement would be that the IWW is presented as a group who did not participate in as many violent actions as they are often accused of.  Now because I wasn't personally on hand for every single event in which the IWW participated, it would be hard to verify this as truth, but my stateside grandfather, who was an original Wobblie and a member of the IBEW, often talked about how claims of IWW violence were exaggerated by management and government for political purposes.  Me?  I believe my grandfather."
Thor: Love and Thunder,2.5,"The movie is lacklustre compared to other marval movies at best, the movie try's to pull poor jokes at every corner and is somewhat of a bore to watch, a lot of key plot points in the movie are just scratched over and don't make sense when Considering an actual narrative, in short the movie feels like a tired spinoff that shouldn't have made the cut."
Thor: Love and Thunder,2,The laziest MCU rendition yet! Dumb Thor isn't exactly my cup of tea!
Thor: Love and Thunder,5,I thought it was one of Marvel's funniest movies and had a nice Rhythm between being funny and serious when it needed to be. The stakes felt appropriate and it was nice to take a break from the massive Stakes of other Marvel movies.
Thor: Love and Thunder,5,One of my favourite Marvel movies.
Thor: Love and Thunder,3,"Meh exactly. entertaining, very well made, but missing something. I feel like there was another story line trapped in this movie someplace, very powerful actors mixed with very ""meh"" actors. feels like there's two movies trying to make it into one."
The Black Phone,1.5,- Ring Ring - Who's there? - Boredom.
